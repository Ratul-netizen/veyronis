//! Stopping without dropping anything on the floor.
//!
//! A container runtime sends `SIGTERM` and then, some seconds later, `SIGKILL`. Between
//! those two the process decides what kind of shutdown this is.
//!
//! Without a handler, `SIGTERM` terminates immediately: every in-flight request becomes
//! a connection reset, and a client that was halfway through a write cannot tell a
//! deploy from a crash and retries — which, for a write, may not be safe. With one, the
//! listener stops accepting, the requests already running finish, and the process exits
//! having answered everything it accepted.
//!
//! `SIGINT` is handled the same way, because an operator pressing ctrl-C on a terminal
//! deserves the same treatment as an orchestrator, and because a second ctrl-C still
//! kills the process outright — the impatient path is already there and does not need
//! to be the only one.
//!
//! # Why this is a third copy
//!
//! `uops_server::shutdown` and `uops_poller::shutdown` are the other two. The binaries
//! have no crate below them that is the right home for it: `uops-core` is deliberately
//! dependency-light — it builds for WASM, which is why it does not link a database
//! driver — and a tokio signal handler in it would be paid for by every consumer,
//! including the ones that have no process to signal. A dependency edge between the
//! binaries would pull axum, or the SNMP stack, in to reuse thirty lines.
//!
//! The risk of a copy is drift, so what differs is worth naming. The server drains
//! requests it accepted. The poller abandons a tick it has not finished. **This daemon
//! drains**: the receivers stop, the workers finish what is in the channels, and the
//! batcher writes what it is holding — because the alternative is losing up to a full
//! batch of somebody's logs on every deploy.
//!
//! The shared part is *when*, which is the platform's and not something any of them gets
//! to decide. If that changes, all three change.

/// Resolves when the process is asked to stop.
///
/// On Unix, `SIGTERM` or `SIGINT`. On Windows there is no `SIGTERM`, so this is ctrl-C
/// alone; that is the platform's own shape and not a gap to apologise for, and a
/// developer on Windows is the only one who reaches it.
