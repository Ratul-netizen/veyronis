//! `TenantScope` — tenant isolation enforced by the type system.
//!
//! SPEC §M0.8 is explicit that this must not rely on "remember to add
//! `WHERE tenant_id = $1`". Every query builder and repository function takes a
//! `&TenantScope`, and a `TenantScope` cannot be constructed from nothing — so a
//! missing tenant filter is a compile error rather than a silent cross-tenant read.
//!
//! The constructors are deliberately few, deliberately named, and deliberately
//! greppable:
//!
//! | constructor | when |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`TenantScope::from_authenticated`] | normal path, from a verified session |
//! | [`TenantScope::system`] | background workers with no user (pollers, alert eval) |
//! | [`TenantScope::for_test`] | `#[cfg(test)]` only — cannot exist in a release build |
