//! Typed identifiers.
//!
//! These are newtypes rather than bare `Uuid` for one reason: SPEC §M0.8 requires that
//! tenant isolation be enforced by the type system rather than by review discipline.
//! A function taking `(TenantId, ResourceId)` cannot be called with the arguments
//! swapped; a function taking `(Uuid, Uuid)` can, and that mistake is invisible in a
//! diff and catastrophic in production.
//!
//! All IDs are **`UUIDv7`** — time-ordered, so they cluster in PostgreSQL indexes and
//! sort coherently in `ClickHouse` instead of scattering writes across the whole keyspace
//! the way v4 does.
