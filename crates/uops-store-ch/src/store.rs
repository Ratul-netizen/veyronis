//! The storage traits, and `ClickHouse` behind them — SPEC §M0.6.
//!
//! This is where the two halves M0 built separately finally meet: `uops-query` has
//! compiled telemetry SQL since M0 and `ch-migrations` has created the schema since the
//! migration runner, and until now nothing had ever executed one against the other.
//!
//! # Two deviations from the SPEC signatures, both deliberate
//!
//! **`query` takes the resolved resources.** SPEC writes `query(&self, q, scope)`.
//! Expanding a `ResourceSelector` is a `PostgreSQL` round trip through `resource_alias`,
//! and doing it inside a `ClickHouse` store would put the control plane in the middle of
//! a telemetry read. The caller resolves once and passes the result — which is also what
//! keeps `uops-query`'s golden tests free of a database.
//!
//! **`tail` returns a page, not a stream.** SPEC sketches the live tail as a stream, and
//! the signature here is deliberately the same shape as `query`: one window in, one
//! collected `ResultSet` out. `MergeTree` has no change feed — anything calling itself a
//! stream would be this poll with a connection held open in front of it, and a held-open
//! connection is the part that on-premise proxies drop at sixty seconds. What makes the
//! result a stream rather than a repeated search is the *window*, which is half-open on
//! `ingested_at`, so consecutive polls partition the rows exactly once each. See
//! [`uops_query::follow`].
