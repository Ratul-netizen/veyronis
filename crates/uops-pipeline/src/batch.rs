//! Turning a stream of rows into the few large inserts `ClickHouse` wants.
//!
//! SPEC §M3, and it is not a preference:
//!
//! > `ClickHouse` wants **large, infrequent inserts** — target 10 000–100 000 rows or
//! > 1 second, whichever comes first. Per-row inserts will destroy it. On insert failure,
//! > retry with backoff and spill to a local WAL after N failures; never drop in-memory
//! > batches on a transient `ClickHouse` restart.
//!
//! Every `INSERT` creates a part, and a `MergeTree` merges parts in the background. A
//! thousand inserts a second creates a thousand parts a second, the merge scheduler falls
//! behind, and the server starts refusing writes with `TOO_MANY_PARTS` — at which point
//! ingest stops entirely. The failure is not gradual and it is not obvious from the
//! insert side.
//!
//! # Why both a row count and a deadline
//!
//! The row count is what makes the insert efficient. The deadline is what makes a quiet
//! system usable: a customer sending forty messages a minute would otherwise wait four
//! hours to see the first one, and "my logs are not arriving" is indistinguishable from
//! a broken receiver.
//!
//! # Why the buffer is never dropped
//!
//! A `ClickHouse` restart takes seconds and is a routine thing — an upgrade, a
//! configuration reload, an OOM kill. A pipeline that discarded its buffer each time
//! would lose exactly the logs written during the incident somebody is investigating. So
//! a failed insert is retried with backoff and the rows are kept.
//!
//! # Where the WAL comes in
//!
//! Retrying in memory handles the ten-second restart. It does not handle the ten-*minute*
//! one: memory is bounded, and past [`Config::max_buffered`] the oldest rows were dropped.
//!
//! So after [`wal::Config::spill_after`](crate::wal::Config::spill_after) consecutive
//! failures the buffer is written to disk and cleared, and ingestion continues with an
//! empty buffer against a `ClickHouse` that is still down. Spilled segments are replayed,
//! oldest first, once an insert succeeds again.
//!
//! A batcher given no WAL keeps the old behaviour exactly. That is not a fallback for
//! convenience: the tests for the in-memory bound are about what happens when there is
//! nowhere to spill *to*, which is a real deployment — a read-only container, or an
//! operator who would rather lose logs than fill a disk.
