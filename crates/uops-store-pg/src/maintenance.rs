//! Maintenance windows, stored.
//!
//! The occurrence arithmetic is [`uops_core::maintenance`] — pure, so the awkward cases
//! (a spring-forward hour that does not exist, two ambiguous local times in an autumn
//! fall-back) are testable without a database. This is the row, the CRUD, and the one
//! query the alert engine will ask.
//!
//! # Why "which windows exist" and "which are open" are separate
//!
//! [`live_windows`](PgStore::live_windows) returns every window in the tenant that has not
//! expired; the caller asks each one [`Schedule::is_open_at`]. Pushing the occurrence
//! rules into SQL would mean writing them twice, in two languages, with the DST edge cases
//! in both — and the two copies would disagree eventually, silently, in whichever
//! direction nobody tested.
//!
//! It is also cheap. Windows are written by hand and a tenant has them in the tens, so
//! "every live window" is a small result set that an alert engine can hold and refresh on
//! an interval rather than query per evaluation.
//!
//! # What this deliberately does not do
//!
//! Decide anything. The alert engine in M4 owns *whether to suppress*; this stops at
//! "here are the windows and what each one covers". Building the suppression before the
//! thing being suppressed exists would be guessing at an interface.
