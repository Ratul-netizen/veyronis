//! Discovery jobs, runs and candidates — M5, `docs/M5-discovery.md`.
//!
//! Not to be confused with [`crate::discovery`], which is also called discovery and is a
//! different thing: it keys the *children* of a device already known. This is about
//! finding the device.
//!
//! # Why the ranges are validated twice
//!
//! [`PgStore::create_discovery_job`] asks [`Sweep::check`] before it writes the row, and
//! migration 0017 has CHECK constraints saying the same things. That is deliberate rather
//! than redundant.
//!
//! The constraint is what makes the limit true — of every writer, including a future one
//! that forgets, and including `psql`. But a CHECK produces `violates
//! discovery_job_no_range_wider_than_a_16`, and an operator who reads that has learned
//! only that they are wrong. [`SweepError`] produces the sentence that says what to do
//! instead, and §4's fourth acceptance criterion is about the sentence, not the refusal.
//!
//! So: the crate gives the message, the schema gives the guarantee.
//!
//! # Why the ranges cross the boundary as text
//!
//! `cidr[]` has no `sqlx` mapping without the `ipnetwork` feature, and adding a
//! dependency to move a value that [`uops_discover::Range`] already models properly would
//! be the wrong trade. They are cast in the SQL and parsed on the way back, so everything
//! above this module holds a `Range` and nothing holds a string that might not be one.
