//! Which resources the poller can actually reach.
//!
//! A `resource` row is not a device. It becomes one when it has somewhere to send a
//! packet and something to authenticate with, and the join that establishes both is the
//! whole of this module.
//!
//! # Why the address is an identifier and not a column
//!
//! `resource` has no `address` column, deliberately. An address is an *identifier* —
//! SPEC §M0.2's tier 3, confidence 0.80 — and putting it in a column would make it two
//! things at once: the thing identity resolution matches on, and the thing the poller
//! dials. They drift the moment DHCP moves a device, and then one of them is wrong with
//! nothing to say which.
//!
//! So the poller reads `resource_identifier` where `kind = 'mgmt_ip'`, which is the same
//! row identity resolution wrote. A device that is re-addressed is re-identified and
//! re-dialled by the same fact changing once.
//!
//! # Why `sysObjectID` is an attribute
//!
//! Profile resolution matches on it, and getting it requires polling the device — so a
//! poller that read it fresh every cycle would spend a round trip per device per cycle
//! rediscovering something that changes when the hardware is replaced. It is cached in
//! `resource.attributes` under `snmp.sysobjectid` by the poll that discovers it, and
//! read from there afterwards.
