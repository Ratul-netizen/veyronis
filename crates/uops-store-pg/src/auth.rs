//! Users, roles and sessions.
//!
//! This is the layer that makes `TenantScope::from_authenticated` reachable honestly.
//! Everything M0 built rests on that one function only ever being called after a real
//! session has been verified against a real role, so the checks here are the foundation
//! of every isolation guarantee above them.
//!
//! Two deliberate shapes:
//!
//! * **The store never sees a password.** It stores and returns a PHC hash; verifying is
//!   `uops_secrets::password`, and deciding is the API. A repository that took a
//!   plaintext password would be a repository that could log one.
//! * **Session lookup is one statement that also touches the clock.** Validate, slide
//!   the idle timeout, and enforce the absolute cap together — on the hot path of every
//!   authenticated request, three round trips would be three times the cost of the thing
//!   being protected.
