//! The resource repository.
//!
//! Every statement in this file filters on `tenant_id`, and every public method takes a
//! `&TenantScope` to get it. That is not a convention here — `enforced.rs` reads this
//! source file and fails the build if a query appears without it.
//!
//! Note what the scope is *not* used for: it is never interpolated. `TenantScope` is not
//! `Display` precisely so that it cannot be, and the tenant reaches the statement as a
//! bound parameter like every other value.
