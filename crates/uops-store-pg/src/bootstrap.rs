//! The first run.
//!
//! An empty database cannot be administered, because administering it requires an
//! account and creating an account requires an administrator. Something has to break
//! that circle, and every way of breaking it is a hole of some size:
//!
//! | approach | the hole |
//! |---|---|
//! | shipped default credentials | every install shares them, and most never change them |
//! | a setup wizard on an open port | the window between first boot and first login is unauthenticated |
//! | an env var with the password | it is in the shell history, the compose file, and the process table |
//! | generate once, print once | the operator must read the log of the first boot |
//!
//! The last one is chosen. It has a real cost — if nobody reads that output, the only
//! way back in is to empty `app_user` and boot again — and in exchange there is no
//! moment at which this system is reachable by someone who has not been told a secret,
//! and no secret that is the same on two installations.
//!
//! # Why it is one transaction
//!
//! Bootstrap writes four rows across four tables: an organization, a tenant inside it,
//! a user in that organization, and an admin role binding the user to the tenant. A
//! partial bootstrap is worse than none — an org with no admin cannot be administered
//! and cannot be bootstrapped again, because [`bootstrap_first_run`] declines the
//! moment any user exists. It commits or it does not happen.
//!
//! # Why it takes an advisory lock
//!
//! Two replicas starting at once would both see an empty `app_user`, both generate a
//! password, and both insert — leaving two admins, of which the operator was shown
//! whichever log they happened to read. `SELECT EXISTS` does not take a lock that
//! prevents this; even `SERIALIZABLE` would give one of them an error to handle at the
//! least convenient moment in the process lifetime. A transaction-scoped advisory lock
//! makes the second replica wait, see the first one's user, and decline. It is released
//! on commit or rollback, including if the process is killed mid-bootstrap.
//!
//! # Why the store still never sees a plaintext password
//!
//! It takes a PHC hash, like [`crate::auth::PgStore::create_user`]. Generating the
//! password and printing it belong to the binary that has a terminal to print it on;
//! this module's job is to make the four rows appear together or not at all.
