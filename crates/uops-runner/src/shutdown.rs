//! Stopping without dropping anything on the floor.
//!
//! A container runtime sends `SIGTERM` and then, some seconds later, `SIGKILL`. Between
//! those two the process decides what kind of shutdown this is.
//!
//! Without a handler, `SIGTERM` terminates immediately: every in-flight request becomes
//! a connection reset, and a client that was halfway through a write cannot tell a
//! deploy from a crash and retries — which, for a write, may not be safe. With one, the
//! listener stops accepting, the requests already running finish, and the process exits
//! having answered everything it accepted.
//!
//! `SIGINT` is handled the same way, because an operator pressing ctrl-C on a terminal
//! deserves the same treatment as an orchestrator, and because a second ctrl-C still
//! kills the process outright — the impatient path is already there and does not need
//! to be the only one.
//!
//! # Why this is a copy of `uops_server::shutdown`
//!
//! The two binaries have no crate below them that is the right home for it. `uops-core`
//! is deliberately dependency-light — it builds for WASM, which is why it does not link
//! a database driver — and a tokio signal handler in it would be paid for by every
//! consumer including the ones that have no process to signal. The alternative, a
//! dependency edge from the poller to the server, would pull axum and the whole route
//! table in to reuse thirty lines.
//!
//! The risk of a copy is drift, so: what a runner shuts down is not what a server or a
//! poller shuts down. A runner finishes the step it has already sent — see
//! `crate::execute` — because abandoning it would leave the product not knowing what the
//! device did with it. The only shared part is *when*, which is the platform's and not
//! something any of them gets to decide. If that changes, all three change.

/// Resolves when the process is asked to stop.
///
/// On Unix, `SIGTERM` or `SIGINT`. On Windows there is no `SIGTERM`, so this is ctrl-C
/// alone; that is the platform's own shape and not a gap to apologise for, and a
/// developer on Windows is the only one who reaches it.
