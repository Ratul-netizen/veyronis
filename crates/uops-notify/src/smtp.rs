//! The email transport.
//!
//! A plain SMTP conversation with a relay on the customer's own network. Four decisions,
//! and the first one is the one that shapes the rest:
//!
//! # No TLS, and therefore no AUTH
//!
//! This workspace carries no TLS by decision — see the root `Cargo.toml`: the rustls and
//! native-tls trees carry licences outside the `cargo-deny` allow-list. For a webhook that
//! means "point it at your egress proxy". For SMTP it means something stronger, and worth
//! stating rather than working around:
//!
//! **Authenticated submission is not supported, deliberately.** `AUTH PLAIN` over an
//! unencrypted connection sends the password base64-encoded, which is to say in clear. A
//! build that offered it would be inviting somebody to put their Microsoft 365 password in
//! a config field and send it across a network in the clear, and no amount of documentation
//! makes that safe. So this speaks to a **smarthost**: a relay that accepts mail from the
//! hosts on its own network, which is what an on-premise mail setup already has and what
//! `ssmtp`, `nullmailer` and every appliance in this category assume.
//!
//! A deployment that must reach an authenticated provider puts a submission proxy in
//! front — the same answer syslog-over-TLS and https webhooks got, for the same reason.
//!
//! # The other three
//!
//! **Header injection is refused, not escaped.** A newline in an address or a subject is
//! either an attack or a typo; either way the message it would produce is not the one
//! anybody meant. Addresses are checked when the channel is written, and the subject is
//! checked again when the message is built, because a rule's name reaches it and a rule
//! can be renamed after the channel was made.
//!
//! **Dot-stuffing is not optional.** A body line consisting of a single `.` ends the
//! message. `system.cpu` never produces one, but a log line pasted into a rule description
//! can, and the failure is a truncated email with the rest of it interpreted as SMTP
//! commands.
//!
//! **A non-ASCII subject is encoded.** Device names are not all ASCII, and a raw UTF-8
//! subject is a specification violation that different relays handle differently — some
//! pass it, some mangle it, one rejects the message. RFC 2047 is four lines of base64.
