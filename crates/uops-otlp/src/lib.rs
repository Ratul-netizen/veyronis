//! OTLP, decoded into the rows the rest of the product already stores.
//!
//! SPEC §M3 asks for an OTLP receiver implementing `LogsService`, `MetricsService` and
//! `TraceService`. This crate is the half that has nothing to do with transport: protobuf
//! in, [`LogRow`] and [`MetricRow`] out, plus the [`ObservedIdentity`] that decides which
//! resource they belong to.
//!
//! # Why this is almost no work, and why that is the point
//!
//! A syslog message and an OTLP record become the *same row*. Not a similar row — the
//! same type, with the same keys, resolved by the same resolver, batched by the same
//! batcher. That is what SPEC §M0.3 bought when it required OpenTelemetry semantic
//! conventions instead of a bespoke schema:
//!
//! > `host.name`, `service.name`, `source.address` rather than `src_ip`
//!
//! `uops-syslog::normalize` had to *translate* into those names. This does not: OTLP is
//! already in them. The whole conversion is unwrapping protobuf `AnyValue`s and mapping a
//! severity number, which is why it fits in one file with no I/O and no async.
//!
//! # HTTP first, gRPC deferred, and the reason is the dependency tree
//!
//! SPEC names `opentelemetry-proto` with `gen-tonic`, which generates gRPC service stubs
//! and pulls **tonic, h2 and tower** in with them. `gen-tonic-messages` generates the
//! same protobuf structs and pulls neither, because OTLP/HTTP carries **byte-identical
//! protobuf bodies** — the difference is the framing, not the payload.
//!
//! So the receiver speaks OTLP/HTTP on the axum stack that already exists, and this crate
//! adds `prost` and `opentelemetry-proto` and nothing else. The OpenTelemetry Collector's
//! `otlphttp` exporter is first-class and needs no translation, so this is a complete
//! answer rather than a stopgap.
//!
//! gRPC is worth adding when something needs it. It is a feature and a service impl over
//! the same functions in this file, not a rewrite — and it is a decision about carrying
//! three more dependencies, which in this project is a decision rather than a default.
//!
//! # Traces, and why they were late
//!
//! SPEC was explicit that they should be: *"trace accepts and stores nothing until M8 —
//! accept and drop with a counter, so instrumented apps don't error."* An application
//! whose exporter gets a 404 logs an error every batch forever, so accepting and counting
//! was the difference between "traces are not stored yet" and "the endpoint is broken",
//! and only one of those was true.
//!
//! M8 arrived, so [`traces`] is here and the counter can stop. It is the same shape as
//! [`logs`] with one addition the other two do not have: a span belongs to a **host** and
//! a **service**, and the caller resolves both. See that module and
//! `docs/M8-observability.md` §2.1.
