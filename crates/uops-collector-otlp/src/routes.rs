//! The three OTLP/HTTP endpoints.
//!
//! # What an exporter is told, and why it matters
//!
//! OTLP defines a `partial_success` in every export response, and it is the difference
//! between a receiver that is honest and one that is not. A receiver that converted nine
//! records of ten and answered `200 {}` would be lying by omission — the exporter would
//! move on, the operator would never know, and the missing tenth would only surface as a
//! chart that is quietly wrong.
//!
//! So everything this cannot store is counted and named in the response: histograms,
//! summaries, and data points with no timestamp. An operator whose latency histograms
//! never appear learns it from their own collector's logs rather than from an absent
//! chart three weeks later.
//!
//! # Status codes
//!
//! `200` when the payload was understood, whatever fraction of it could be stored.
//! `400` when the protobuf did not decode, which is a bug in the sender and is not worth
//! retrying. `503` when the queue to the batcher is closed, which means this process is
//! shutting down and the exporter **should** retry — the OTLP specification says a 503 is
//! retryable and that is exactly the behaviour wanted.
//!
//! Notably not `429`. Backpressure here is the handler *waiting* on a bounded channel,
//! which becomes the exporter waiting on the response, which is what HTTP already does
//! well. Telling a collector to go away and come back is worse than making it wait.
