//! SPEC §M3's first acceptance criterion, measured through the daemon.
//!
//! > 50 000 msg/s sustained syslog ingest on a single node, with drop counter at zero
//!
//! ```bash
//! CLICKHOUSE_DB=uops CLICKHOUSE_USER=uops CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD=uops \
//!   cargo test -p uops-collector-syslog --test scale --release -- --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! **Release, and on Linux.** A debug build measures `rustc -O0` rather than the design,
//! and Windows' UDP stack is not what this ships on — the loopback behaves differently
//! enough under load that a number from it would be a number about Windows.
//!
//! # The sender count is the measurement, not the rate
//!
//! 50 000 msg/s from one device is a benchmark of an LRU lookup. Every message carries
//! the same two identifiers, the resolution cache answers all of them, and PostgreSQL is
//! never touched — which proves that a mutex is fast.
//!
//! What SPEC is actually asking is whether the *product* keeps up, and the product
//! resolves identity per message against an estate. So this sends from [`DEVICES`]
//! distinct source addresses, each with its own hostname, which is what makes the cache
//! a cache rather than a single entry: `DEVICES` entries, `DEVICES` cold resolutions
//! against real `PostgreSQL`, and everything after that a hit.
//!
//! Distinct sources need distinct addresses, and on Linux the whole of `127.0.0.0/8` is
//! local — so the senders bind `127.0.0.2` upward. That is the reason this test is
//! Linux-only and not a portability oversight.
//!
//! # What is measured, and what "sustained 50 000 msg/s" can mean
//!
//! A generator paced at exactly R messages a second finishes `R × T` messages in **at
//! least** T seconds — always slightly more, because nothing is instantaneous. So a
//! measured rate of `offered / elapsed` can never exceed R, and an assertion that it does
//! is unsatisfiable by construction. Two versions of this test asserted exactly that and
//! reported 49 914/s and 49 945/s against a target of 50 000, both times while the daemon
//! had taken every single message and dropped none.
//!
//! The criterion is really a conjunction, and it is asserted as one:
//!
//! 1. the load really was offered at the rate — otherwise nothing below is a measurement
//!    of the daemon;
//! 2. everything offered was **received** — no shortfall;
//! 3. the drop counter is **zero**, which is the half SPEC states outright;
//! 4. everything received reached `ClickHouse`.
//!
//! Received, dropped and written all three, because two of them can look fine while the
//! third is the failure. A receiver that took every datagram and a batcher that lost them
//! is not ingest; nor is a process that kept up by dropping.
//!
//! Then, separately and reported rather than asserted, the **headroom**: the same senders
//! unpaced, to find where it does break. A system that passes at its target and has no
//! margin above it passes until the customer grows.
//!
//! Throughput is measured over the **steady-state** window, after the devices are known.
//! Including the cold resolutions would measure `DEVICES` `PostgreSQL` round trips
//! amortised over the run, which is a real cost but not the sustained rate SPEC names.
