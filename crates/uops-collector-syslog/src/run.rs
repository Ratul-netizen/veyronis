//! # Why the workers fan out and the batcher does not
//!
//! A worker's job is resolve → normalize, and resolution is a cache hit almost always —
//! a mutex and an LRU lookup, fast enough that one worker would do. The exception is what
//! matters: a **miss** awaits `PostgreSQL`, and with a single worker one slow lookup
//! stalls every message behind it. So each listener fans out to several.
//!
//! The batcher is the opposite. Its whole purpose is to make inserts *few and large*, and
//! a second batcher would halve the size of every insert while doubling the part count —
//! which is the failure mode `uops_pipeline::batch` exists to prevent. One batcher, shared
//! by every tenant, because a `LogRow` carries its own `tenant_id` and `ClickHouse` sorts
//! by it.
//!
//! # Where backpressure comes from, and where it stops
//!
//! Every channel here is bounded, and each hop uses `send` — which waits — rather than
//! `try_send`. So a slow `ClickHouse` slows the batcher, which fills the row channel,
//! which slows the workers, which fills the received channel, which stops the TCP receiver
//! reading, which shrinks the receive window, which slows the sender. The chain is
//! deliberate and it is the whole design.
//!
//! It stops at UDP, because UDP has no back channel. The receiver drops and counts, which
//! is `uops_syslog::receiver`'s decision and the reason it uses `try_send`: a drop in
//! userspace is a number somebody can see, and a drop in the kernel is not.
//!
//! # Shutdown
//!
//! In order, and the order is the point: receivers stop first, then the channels close as
//! each stage drains, and the batcher writes what it is holding before it returns. A
//! shutdown that dropped the buffer would lose up to a full batch on every deploy.
