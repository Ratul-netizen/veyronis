//! What the daemon is told, and what it refuses to start without.
//!
//! # How a syslog message gets a tenant
//!
//! This is the decision the whole file exists to record, because a syslog message
//! **carries no tenant and cannot be made to**. RFC 5424 has structured data and nobody
//! populates it; RFC 3164 has a hostname and a body. There is no field to put a customer
//! in, and if there were, the sender would control it.
//!
//! So the tenant comes from **where the message arrived**: one listener per tenant, on
//! its own address or port. That is how every multi-tenant collector does it, and the
//! reason is that the binding is the one thing the sender cannot influence.
//!
//! The alternative considered and not taken was an explicit sender-address allow-list,
//! with unknown senders refused. It is a tighter posture and it loses the logs of every
//! device somebody forgot to register — which are disproportionately the devices
//! involved in an incident, because an unregistered device is one nobody is watching.
//! An operator who wants that posture can have it at the firewall, where it belongs, and
//! where it is one rule rather than a second identity system.
//!
//! **An unknown sender inside a listener's tenant is not dropped.** The resolver creates
//! a provisional resource and a review-queue item, which is rule 1 of SPEC §M0.2 —
//! *never block ingestion* — and means a device that starts logging before anybody adds
//! it to inventory still has its logs when somebody goes looking.
//!
//! # Why a file and not environment variables
//!
//! A listener list is inherently a list, and `UOPS_SYSLOG_LISTENER_0_UDP` is not
//! configuration, it is a workaround. The monitoring profiles are YAML for the same
//! reason: a human writes this, reviews it, and puts it in a change ticket.
//!
//! The connection strings stay in the environment, because those carry passwords and a
//! file on disk is a file in a backup.
