//! Recording who read what, and who changed what — SPEC §M0.8.
//!
//! # Where the hook lives, and why it is there
//!
//! SPEC says "implemented once as Axum middleware over the query and resource routes".
//! A layer wrapped around a chosen list of routes has one failure mode: someone adds a
//! twenty-first route and does not add it to the list. So the hook is attached to
//! [`crate::Caller`] instead — the extractor a handler *must* use to obtain a
//! `TenantScope`, and therefore the only way to reach tenant data at all.
//!
//! A handler cannot read a customer's data without a scope, cannot get a scope without
//! the extractor, and cannot use the extractor without registering here. Authorisation
//! and auditing share a chokepoint, which is what makes "did we log that read"
//! answerable by reading one file rather than every route.
//!
//! # What the handler adds
//!
//! The extractor knows the actor, the tenant and the address. Only the handler knows
//! what was actually read — which resource, how many rows, what shape of query — so it
//! fills that in through [`Audit`], and the middleware writes the row once the response
//! is known.
//!
//! # A failed write does not fail the request
//!
//! An audit-log outage must not become a platform outage. It is reported where an
//! operator will see it and the response goes out regardless — the same position
//! `uops-secrets` takes for credential access, and for the same reason.
