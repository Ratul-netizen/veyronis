//! API errors, as RFC 7807 `problem+json`.
//!
//! SPEC conventions: one error type per crate boundary, and the API maps them onto
//! problem+json. The mapping is deliberately lossy in one direction — several distinct
//! internal failures become the same response — and that is the point rather than an
//! oversight.
//!
//! # What a client is allowed to learn
//!
//! A tenant the caller has no role on returns **404**, not 403. So does a resource in
//! another tenant. Confirming that something exists but is forbidden tells an MSP
//! customer that another customer exists, and at what ID — which is exactly the
//! inventory leak `uops_core::Error::TenantMismatch` is written to avoid. The one place
//! 403 is correct is a tenant the caller *can* see but lacks the role for: they already
//! know it exists.
