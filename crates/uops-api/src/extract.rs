//! The authenticated scope extractor.
//!
//! **This is the only place in the product where `TenantScope::from_authenticated` is
//! called.** Every isolation guarantee M0 built rests on that: the type system prevents
//! a query without a scope, the schema prevents a row referencing another tenant, and
//! this function is what decides that a scope may exist at all.
//!
//! Four things have to be true before one is produced, and each of them is a separate
//! refusal rather than a combined check:
//!
//! 1. A session cookie is present.
//! 2. It names a live session — not expired, not revoked, and not belonging to a
//!    disabled account. All four are one statement in `touch_session`.
//! 3. The request names a tenant.
//! 4. The user holds a role on *that* tenant.
//!
//! # Why the tenant is a header and not a path segment
//!
//! `/api/v1/resources`, not `/api/v1/tenants/{id}/resources`. An MSP engineer's session
//! spans several customers, and the alternative to naming the tenant per request is
//! storing a "currently selected" one on the session — which means a request's meaning
//! depends on invisible state, an audit row can be ambiguous about which customer was
//! read, and a stolen cookie carries a selection with it. Naming it per request makes
//! every log line unambiguous.
//!
//! A custom header is also a CSRF defence in its own right: a cross-origin form cannot
//! set one without a preflight the browser will refuse. That is a second layer under the
//! double-submit token, not a replacement for it.
