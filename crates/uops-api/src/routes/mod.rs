//! The route table.

//! Assembled in one place so the surface reads as a list rather than being discovered by

//! `POST /api/v1/query` takes the AST from SPEC §M0.5 directly — the same type the UI
//! builds, saved alerts are instances of, and the M6 text language will parse onto.
//! There is one path to telemetry, and this is it.
