//! SPEC §M1 acceptance: *a user in tenant A cannot read anything from tenant B —
//! verified by an integration test that attempts it on every endpoint, not by
//! inspection.*
//!
//! The words that make this hard to write honestly are **every endpoint**. A file of
//! hand-written cases is inspection wearing a test's clothes: it passes forever, and the
//! twenty-first route added next year is not in it. Nobody notices, because nothing
//! fails.
//!
//! So the route table is read out of `src/routes/mod.rs` at compile time and every route
//! in it must appear in the table below. Adding a route without deciding what isolation
//! means for it breaks this test at the coverage assertion, before any request is sent.
//! That is the same trick `uops-store-pg::enforced` plays on SQL statements, for the
//! same reason: a rule that depends on people remembering is a rule with a half-life.
//!
//! # What "cannot read" is worth testing at
//!
//! Two attacks, and the second is the dangerous one.
//!
//! 1. **Naming someone else's tenant.** `X-Uops-Tenant: <B>` from a user with no role on
//!    B. Expected: 404, never 403 — a tenant you cannot see does not exist, and 403
//!    would confirm that it does.
//!
//! 2. **Naming your own tenant and someone else's object.** `X-Uops-Tenant: <A>` with
//!    B's resource id in the path. This is the one that gets shipped: the tenant check
//!    passes, and whether the object comes back depends on whether the *repository*
//!    filters by tenant rather than on whether the extractor ran. It is exactly what
//!    `TenantScope` and the composite foreign keys exist for, and exactly what a
//!    hand-written test suite tends to leave out.
//!
//! Both must be indistinguishable from asking for something that was never there.
