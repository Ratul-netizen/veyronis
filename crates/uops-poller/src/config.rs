//! Everything the poller reads from its environment.
//!
//! Three of these are chosen against convenience.
//!
//! **There is no default KEK.** The server can start without one because nothing it
//! does on a fresh database needs to open a credential. The poller's whole job is to
//! open credentials, so a poller with no key ring is a process that will start happily
//! and then fail on every device — which looks like a network problem for as long as it
//! takes someone to read the logs. It refuses to start instead, naming the variable.
//!
//! **The reload interval is a minute, not a second.** Devices are added by a human
//! through the API; re-reading the fleet on every tick would mean a query per second per
//! tenant for the benefit of noticing a new switch up to fifty-nine seconds sooner.
//!
//! **The device budget defaults below the tick.** A device given longer than a second
//! to answer can still be in flight when its next poll comes due, and SPEC §M2's first
//! acceptance criterion is about a *fleet*, where one slow device holding a slot is how
//! the whole schedule slips.
