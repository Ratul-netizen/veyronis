//! The loop.
//!
//! Everything below this file has tests. This is the order those things happen in, which
//! is the part that cannot be unit-tested and the part an operator experiences:
//!
//! ```text
//!   reload    every tenant's devices and profiles, into the schedule
//!   tick      once a second: what the wheel says is due
//!   run       per task: ask the device, convert, write
//!   report    what failed, once per device per reload window
//! ```
//!
//! # Why a tick does not wait for its tasks
//!
//! [`uops_poll::poller::run_tick`] dispatches and returns; the executor bounds
//! concurrency and each task bounds its own time. A tick that waited would let one slow
//! device delay the next second's work, which is exactly the failure SPEC §M2 names —
//! and it would do so invisibly, as a schedule that gradually slips rather than a device
//! that reports a timeout.
//!
//! # Why failures are reported once per device per reload window
//!
//! A device that is down fails every poll. At a 60-second interval that is 1 440 lines a
//! day for one device, and a fleet with fifty such devices produces a log in which
//! nothing else can be found. Each device's first failure is printed; the rest are
//! counted and summarised, and the set is cleared on reload so a device that is still
//! down says so again every minute rather than never.
