//! Warnings returned alongside results — SPEC §M0.5 requirement 4.
//!
//! A warning is not an error. The query runs. It exists because W1 measured several

//! decide whether to narrow it. Silently running a two-second full-tenant scan and
//! silently downsampling to five-minute averages are both worse than saying so.
