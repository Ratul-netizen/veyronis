//! `Query` → parameterised `ClickHouse` SQL.
//!
//! The contract, from SPEC §M0.5:
//!
//! 1. **`tenant_id` is injected here, never by the caller.** [`compile`] takes a
//!    `&TenantScope` and writes the tenant predicate itself, first, on every statement
//!    it emits. There is no code path in this crate that produces SQL without one, and
//!    `TenantScope` cannot be conjured — it comes from an authenticated request or from
//!    a named system constructor. That chain is the single most important line of
//!    defence for tenant isolation in the product.
//! 2. Resources are resolved through `resource_alias` before codegen — see
//!    [`crate::resolve`].
//! 3. Every limit is capped at [`MAX_LIMIT`]; the tail has its own path and its own cap.
//! 4. Queries that cannot use the text index still compile, and return a
//!    [`QueryWarning`] saying so.
//! 5. The output is golden-tested, so any change to it is visible in a diff.
