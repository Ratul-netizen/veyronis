//! The loop.
//!
//! Everything below this file has tests. This is the order those things happen in, which
//! is the part that cannot be unit-tested and the part an operator experiences:
//!
//! ```text
//!   reload    every tenant's enabled rules, into the wheel      every RELOAD
//!   tick      once a second: what the wheel says is due
//!   dispatch  per rule: evaluate, decide, write                 bounded concurrency
//!   report    what fired and what failed                        once per reload window
//! ```
//!
//! # Why a tick does not wait for its evaluations
//!
//! A rule's evaluation is a `ClickHouse` query, and one slow query must not delay every
//! other rule's schedule — that is how an engine starts evaluating a 60-second rule every
//! ninety seconds without anything appearing to be wrong. So a tick dispatches and
//! returns, and [`IN_FLIGHT`] is what bounds the damage instead: an installation whose
//! `ClickHouse` has gone slow ends up with a queue rather than with a thousand concurrent
//! statements.
//!
//! # Why failures are summarised rather than printed
//!
//! A rule whose query fails, fails every cycle. At a 60-second interval that is 1 440
//! lines a day for one rule, and an installation with fifty such rules produces a log in
//! which nothing else can be found. The first of each is printed and the rest are
//! counted, and the set is cleared on reload — so a rule that is still broken says so
//! again every minute rather than never.
