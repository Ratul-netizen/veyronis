//! Getting an `SNMPv3` credential, and being honest about what it buys.
//!
//! SPEC §M2 acceptance: *"`SNMPv3` authPriv (SHA-256 / AES-256) against a real device;
//! credential fetched through `SecretStore` with an access-log entry."*
//!
//! The access-log entry is not written here. [`uops_secrets::LocalVault::get`] writes one
//! on every call including failures, which is the right place for it — a poller that had
//! to remember to log would eventually be a poller that forgot, and a burst of *failed*
//! credential reads is exactly the signal an auditor wants. What this module adds is the
//! [`AccessContext`] that makes the entry mean something: who asked, and what for.
//!
//! # Weak protocols are reported, not refused
//!
//! A switch bought in 2012 and still in a rack offers `MD5` and `DES` and nothing else.
//! Refusing to poll it is not a security posture, it is an unmonitored switch — and an
//! unmonitored switch is a worse outcome than a monitored one whose SNMP transport is
//! old. So [`Strength`] classifies a credential and the caller decides; SPEC's
//! SHA-256/AES-256 is [`Strength::Strong`], and everything else is visible.
//!
//! This is the same position the product already takes on v1/v2c community strings,
//! which are cleartext on the wire and marked insecure rather than removed.
