//! Everything the server reads from its environment.
//!
//! Two defaults here are chosen against convenience, and both are worth stating.
//!
//! **The listener defaults to loopback.** A server that binds `0.0.0.0` by default is
//! reachable from the whole network the moment it starts, including during the minutes
//! between the first boot and the operator reading the printed password. Binding
//! `0.0.0.0` is a thing you say out loud, in `UOPS_BIND`, once you mean it.
//!
//! **Cookies are `Secure` unless told otherwise.** The exception exists because a
//! developer on `http://localhost` would otherwise watch the browser silently discard
//! every cookie and see an app that is broken for a reason nothing logs. It is spelled
//! `UOPS_INSECURE_COOKIES=1`, which is hard to type by accident and easy to find in a
//! deployment that should not have it.
