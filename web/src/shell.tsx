/**
 * The three pieces of state every view shares: which tenant, what time range, and what
 * the view is currently about.
 *
 * All three live in the URL, not in React state and not in storage. That is the decision
 * this file exists to make, and it has consequences everywhere:
 *
 * * A link reproduces a view. "Look at this" in a chat window is the most common thing
 *   an operator does during an incident, and a URL that does not carry the time range is
 *   a URL that shows the recipient something else.
 * * Back and forward work. Widening a window and going back narrows it again, because
 *   the browser already knows how to do that and we did not reimplement it.
 * * Reloading during an incident does not reset you to "last 15 minutes".
 * * Two tabs can be two tenants. An MSP engineer comparing two customers is not an edge
 *   case, and a tenant kept in module state or storage makes it impossible.
 * * A context survives a reload — which is the moment somebody under pressure reaches
 *   for, and the worst moment to silently widen what they are looking at.
 *
 * The cost is that every navigation must carry the search params forward, which
 * TanStack Router does for us, and that the range is parsed from strings on every read.
