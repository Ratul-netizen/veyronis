/**
 * Discovery: jobs, runs, and the candidates an operator works through.
 *
 * Three shapes for three questions, and they are deliberately not one:
 *
 * - a **job** is a standing instruction — what to scan, how often, with which
 *   credentials. It changes rarely and is read as an inventory.
 * - a **run** is one execution. It is append-only and read newest-first.
 * - a **candidate** is the residue: everything a run found and could not turn into a
 *   device, with a sentence saying why. It is a worklist.
 *
 * The server does the arithmetic that two clients could otherwise do differently —
 * `addresses` on a job and `silent` on a run are computed there, because a derived number
 * that disagrees between two screens is a number nobody trusts.
