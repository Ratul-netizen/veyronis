/**
 * The router, the query client, and the one gate between them.
 *
 * # The gate
 *
 * Every route except `/login` renders inside `Authenticated`, which fetches `/me` and
 * sends you to `/login` if that comes back 401. This is a *convenience*, not a
 * protection: the protection is that the server refuses every request without a session,
 * and nothing this file does could weaken or strengthen that. Saying so matters, because
 * a client-side guard that is mistaken for the real one is how an endpoint ends up
 * unprotected on the server "because the UI hides it".
 *
 * # Routes are defined in code
 *
 * TanStack Router's file-based routing generates a route tree into the source directory.
 * That is a build step that writes committed code, and a diff nobody reads. Six routes
 * defined here are six routes anyone can find by opening this file.
