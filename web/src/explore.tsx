/**
 * The Log Explorer: build a query, run it, read the rows — and then follow them.
 *
 * It posts the AST from SPEC §M0.5 directly. There is no query DSL in this app and no
 * translation layer — the controls below assemble the same structure a saved alert is an
 * instance of, and the same one the M6 text language will parse onto. If something can
 * be asked here it can be alerted on, because they are the same object.
 *
 * # Three queries, one filter
 *
 * A run issues the row query, a histogram over the same filter, and a count per value for
 * each sidebar field. All three are *derived* from one `Query` rather than assembled
 * separately — see `toHistogram` and `toFieldCounts` — because a histogram that filtered
 * differently from the rows beneath it would be a chart of something else, and nobody
 * would notice until they counted the bars.
 *
 * # It does not run on its own
 *
 * Changing a control does not fire a query. A telemetry query reads a lot of data, and a
 * UI that runs one on every keystroke bills the customer for the user's typing. The time
 * range is the exception in the other direction: it is shared state, so changing it
 * re-runs whatever was last run, because that is what changing a time range means — and
 * it is what makes drag-to-zoom on the histogram a zoom rather than a redraw.
