# M5 — Discovery: specification

PLAN's roadmap gives this milestone one line: *"CIDR · SNMP · LLDP/CDP · ARP · device
classification."* SPEC covers M0–M4 and says M5+ is deliberately absent, and its own rule
is that *"where a decision is still open it is marked **[OPEN]** and must be closed before
the milestone starts — not during."* This closes them.

## 1. The three things discovery does

**Sweep.** Given a CIDR an operator entered, probe each address and find out what is
there. Produces *candidates*.

**Classify.** Turn a probe response into a vendor, a model, an OS and a monitoring
profile — machinery `uops-profile` already has, reached by `sysObjectID`.

**Walk neighbours.** On a device that is already known, read LLDP, CDP and ARP to find
*adjacent* devices and the links between them. Produces edges, and more candidates.

The third is the one that matters most and is easiest to underrate: an operator enters one
core switch, and neighbour discovery finds the rest of the estate from it. A CIDR sweep is
the fallback for the parts of a network that nothing points at.

---

## 2. Decisions

### 2.1 Discovery probes SNMP directly. ICMP is not a prerequisite.

The obvious design pings first and probes what answers. It is wrong here: a device that
drops ICMP while answering SNMP is common — it is the default on several firewall
platforms and on any host with a restrictive local policy — and a sweep that skips them
silently discovers less than the operator's own network diagram.

So the probe is an SNMP `GET` of three OIDs in one request: `sysObjectID`, `sysName`,
`sysDescr`. That is the liveness test and the classification in a single round trip.
Nothing answers on 161 unless it is an agent, so a response *is* a device.

ICMP stays available as a cheap pre-filter for a large range where the operator says it is
safe — a flag on the job, off by default, and named for what it costs: `skip_silent_hosts`.

### 2.2 Credentials are supplied, never guessed.

A discovery job names the credentials it may use, in order, from the vault. It tries each
once per address.

**It never tries a list of likely community strings.** That is what a scanner does, and it
is wrong for three reasons that are not about taste: it is indistinguishable from an
attack in the customer's own IDS logs, SNMPv3 authentication failures lock accounts on
several platforms, and a product that ships with `public` in a wordlist is a product that
teaches its users that guessing credentials is normal.

An address that answers nothing with the supplied credentials is recorded as
`unreachable`, which is a fact an operator can act on, rather than retried with more
guesses.

### 2.3 A sweep is bounded, and the bound is in the schema.

A discovery job holds CIDRs, not "the network". The rules:

- **A /16 is the largest single range** — 65 536 addresses. Larger is refused when the job
  is written, with the sentence saying to split it. An operator who means a /8 means
  something else.
- **Addresses per job are capped at 65 536** across all its ranges, for the same reason.
- **Concurrency is capped** at `IN_FLIGHT` probes, the rate at `PROBES_PER_SECOND`, and
  each probe at `PROBE_TIMEOUT`. A discovery run must not be the reason a customer's
  network monitoring alerts.

  The three are chosen against each other, which is less obvious than it sounds. A sweep
  of empty addresses — which is almost all of any sweep — runs at
  `IN_FLIGHT / PROBE_TIMEOUT` probes per second *regardless of the rate cap*. Pick them
  independently and the smaller one binds silently while the documented one is
  decoration: the first version of these constants used the poller's five-second timeout
  with 64 in flight, which is 13/s, so a /16 would have taken 85 minutes while appearing
  to be capped at 200/s. A probe therefore has its own timeout — two seconds, because a
  probe is one small `GET` to an address that probably holds nothing, where a poll's five
  seconds is right for a conversation with a device known to exist.
- **Network and broadcast addresses are skipped** in any range of /30 or wider. Not for
  the two addresses: the broadcast address makes every host on the segment answer at
  once, which looks like a tool that has found a great many devices and is one being
  shouted at by the same device several hundred times. A /31 is exempt (RFC 3021 — both
  addresses of a point-to-point link are usable) and a /32 is one host.

The caps are constants in one place, and the schema enforces the first two — a limit that
lives only in the application is one a second caller does not have.

### 2.4 Discovery resolves identity; interface discovery does not.

`uops_store_pg::discovery` explains why an interface bypasses the resolver: its parent is
not in question. A swept device is the opposite case — it is exactly *"a resource that
turned up"*, which is what `create_provisional` and the review queue exist for.

So each probe response becomes an `ObservedIdentity` carrying what it proved:

| Identifier | Tier | Available |
|---|---|---|
| `MgmtIp` — the address probed | 3 | the probe |
| `Hostname` — `sysName` | 4 | the probe |
| `Serial` — `entPhysicalSerialNum` | 1 | the first poll |
| `SnmpEngineId` — `snmpEngineID` (v3) | 1 | the first poll |

The last column is the one that decides the design. **A probe proves nothing globally
unique.** A serial is a table column and needs an index to `GET`; an engine ID belongs to
the v3 session rather than to the MIB. Reading either costs a second conversation with
every address in the range, most of which are empty — so both wait for the first poll,
which is a conversation with something already known to exist, and *upgrade* the
resolution when they arrive.

That is not a limitation to work around; it is why the review queue exists. An address
and a hostname are tier 3 and tier 4, so a sweep lands most results below
`AUTO_MERGE_THRESHOLD` by construction, and a device is identified precisely when it
becomes worth polling.

Each sighting goes through `uops_identity::classify`. Above `AUTO_MERGE_THRESHOLD` it
merges into the existing resource. Below `REVIEW_FLOOR` it creates a new one. Between
them it goes to the review queue — the case a sweep produces constantly: the same
hostname in two sites, a device that changed address, a spare racked with a clone's
configuration.

A review produces a **provisional resource and a review item**, not a review item alone.
An earlier draft of this section said otherwise, and building it showed why the resolver
is right: the provisional row is what a reviewer merges *from*, and without one there is
nothing for the merge to point at. It is also the resolver's contract on every other
ingestion path in this product — a syslog message is never dropped while a human decides
— and discovery does not get a private variant of it. What matters, and what §4 tests, is
that a human was asked rather than a machine deciding.

There is one more case the schema cannot express. An agent that answers with **neither a
name nor a `sysObjectID`** — a UPS, a PDU, an environmental sensor — becomes a candidate
rather than a resource. It exists, so it is written down; but a resource with no name and
no profile is a row nothing can poll and nobody can act on, which is the same objection
§2.5 raises against inventing a device from a chassis ID.

Note what makes rediscovery work, because it is not confidence. An address and a hostname
combine to 0.93, below `AUTO_MERGE_THRESHOLD`, so a second sweep of the same estate would
send every device to review if confidence were the only test. What resolves it is the
resolver's *exclusive match*: every identifier points at one resource and nothing else,
which is a repeat sighting rather than a coincidence.

### 2.5 A neighbour that is not known is a candidate, not a resource.

LLDP and CDP report a neighbour's chassis ID, port and platform. That is enough to create
an edge *if both ends exist*, and not enough to create the far end: a chassis ID is an
identifier, not a device, and inventing a resource from one produces an inventory full of
half-devices that never get polled because nothing knows how to reach them.

So: an edge is written only between two resources that exist. An unknown neighbour becomes
a candidate carrying its chassis ID and management address, and the next sweep — or an
operator pressing *probe* — turns it into a device. Same rule for ARP, which is weaker
still: an ARP entry is a MAC and an IP, and most of them are laptops.

### 2.6 Edges are `connected_to`, and they are not blast radius.

`RelationshipKind::ConnectedTo` is already excluded from dependency traversal, and the
comment in `resource.rs` says why: L2 adjacency is not causation. Discovery produces
`connected_to` and nothing else. `depends_on` is a judgement about services, and M9's
correlation engine is what will infer it.

**And the edge is undirected.** `resource_relationship` is unique on
`(tenant_id, source_id, target_id, kind)`, which stops one walk writing an edge twice and
does nothing about the duplicate that actually occurs: walk both ends of a cable and you
get A→B and B→A, two rows for one link, drawn twice by every topology view. `ConnectedTo`
is symmetric — unlike `DependsOn`, `Hosts` and `Runs` — so the pair is sorted before it is
written. The ordering is by UUID and is arbitrary on purpose: a canonical form, not a
claim about which device matters.

One more rule the implementation needed. A neighbour is matched to an existing resource by
*lookup*, never by resolution — resolution creates, and §2.5 forbids creating the far end.
A tier-1 hit (a chassis ID) decides alone; otherwise every hit must agree. Two resources
answering to one neighbour is an **ambiguous** candidate rather than a coin toss, because
drawing a cable to the wrong building is worse than drawing none.

### 2.7 Every run is a row, and every scan is audited.

Scanning a network is a sensitive operation — it is the thing a customer's security team
will ask about first. A discovery run records who started it, which ranges, when it
finished, how many addresses were probed, how many answered, and what it created. The
audit entry carries the ranges, because "who scanned 10.0.0.0/16 on Tuesday" is the
question that gets asked.

Manual runs are `Operator`. Editing a job's ranges is `Operator`. Reading is `Viewer`.

### 2.8 The scheduler schedules; it does not re-implement discovery.

A job with a schedule has to run without anybody pressing anything, and the piece that
does it is `uops-sweeper`. Everything between claiming a job and closing its run is a call
into code that already existed: `uops_discover::run_with` for the probes,
`PgStore::record_sweep` for the inventory, `PgStore::finish_discovery_run` for the
counters. If a scheduled sweep ever behaves differently from one an operator started by
hand, that is a bug in the scheduler rather than a feature of it.

**There is no in-memory schedule.** The next run is `discovery_job.schedule` plus
`last_run_at`, asked of PostgreSQL once a minute through `discovery_job_due_idx`. A server
that is killed and comes back asks the same question and gets the same answer, so a
restart loses nothing — unlike the alert engine's wheel, which discovery does not need
because jobs are counted in tens and run hourly at their fastest.

**Two schedulers are safe, not merely wasteful.** Migration 0020 puts a partial unique
index over the in-flight run of a job, so the second replica's `INSERT` fails with 23505
and it moves on. The claim is the insert; there is no check-then-insert gap for a second
caller to get into.

**A run whose process died is reaped, not left.** A `running` row blocks its job forever,
because the index that prevents the double sweep cannot tell a live sweep from an
abandoned one. After two hours — five times the longest sweep the schema permits — it is
closed as `failed` with a sentence saying the process stopped before it finished.

**`last_run_at` advances whether or not the sweep worked.** A job that fails every night
must retry tomorrow night, not every single minute; a `last_run_at` that only moved on
success is how a wrong credential becomes a packet flood.

**A sweep that cannot open one of its credentials does not run at all.** Probing with
three of the four an operator configured would record everything the fourth would have
answered as `unreachable`, which is worse than not sweeping because it looks like an
answer. The run fails naming the credential, and the estate is left as it was.

## 3. Schema

```sql
discovery_job       -- what to scan, how often, with which credentials
discovery_run       -- one execution: when, by whom, what it found
discovery_candidate -- an address or a neighbour that is not yet a resource
```

`discovery_candidate` is the table that keeps this honest. It is where an address that
answered but could not be identified goes, where an LLDP neighbour with no matching
resource goes, and where an operator looks to see what discovery found and did not act on.
A product that silently drops what it cannot classify is one whose inventory an operator
cannot trust.

---

## 4. Acceptance criteria

- [x] A /24 sweep against the SNMP simulator finds every agent in it and creates one
      resource per agent, with its `sysObjectID` cached so the first poll resolves the
      right profile (discovery caches; it does not pin — `profile_id` is a human's
      override)
- [x] Re-running the same sweep creates nothing new — the second run resolves every
      address to the resource the first one created
- [x] A device that answers with a hostname matching an existing resource in another site
      produces a **review-queue entry** and not a silent merge — see §2.4 on why it also
      produces a provisional resource
- [x] A CIDR larger than /16 is refused when the job is written, with a sentence saying
      what to do instead
- [x] An LLDP walk between two known devices produces exactly one `connected_to` edge,
      and re-walking produces no duplicate — including when *both ends* are walked, which
      the schema's UNIQUE does not catch and a sorted pair does
- [x] An LLDP neighbour with no matching resource produces a candidate, not a resource
- [x] A sweep stays within its concurrency and rate caps, measured against a paused
      clock — and the three caps are asserted to be consistent with each other, which
      they were not at first
- [x] No code path anywhere tries a credential that was not named by the job
- [x] A job whose schedule has elapsed is swept without anybody pressing anything, and one
      whose schedule has not is left alone — including a disabled job, a manual-only job
      (`schedule IS NULL`) and one that has never run
- [x] Two schedulers over one database sweep a due job once, not twice — the second gets
      the constraint violation and reports it as somebody else's claim rather than as an
      error
- [x] A run left `running` by a process that did not come back is closed after
      `STALE_AFTER`, and its job becomes due again
- [x] A failed sweep still closes its run and still stamps `last_run_at`, so a broken job
      retries on its schedule rather than every turn

## 5. What M5 does not do

**Nmap.** No port scanning, no service fingerprinting, no OS detection by TCP stack
behaviour. The product discovers what answers SNMP and what its neighbours say; a network
scanner is a different product with a different security posture.

**WMI, SSH or agent push.** M5 is SNMP and neighbours. Hosts arrive through the OTel
Collector, which M3 already ships.

**Automatic polling of everything it finds.** A discovered device is created and
classified; whether it is polled is a decision — a profile and a credential assignment —
and doing it automatically is how a discovery run turns into a thousand new SNMP
conversations nobody asked for. The UI offers it as one action on a list.

**An IPv6 sweep.** A /64 is 18 quintillion addresses, so sweeping one is not a slow
version of sweeping a /24, it is a different thing that does not work. The schema refuses
an IPv6 range outright rather than accepting one and timing out. IPv6 devices arrive
through neighbour discovery, which does not enumerate anything.

**Topology layout.** M5 produces edges. Drawing them is M6.
