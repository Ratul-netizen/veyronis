# `verify` is the one that earns its keep. uops-query's golden files record the exact
# SQL the compiler emits; ch-migrations records the exact schema the product creates.
# Nothing else checks that those two agree, and the way they drift is silent — a
# renamed column or a function that does not exist passes every unit test on both
# sides. It has already caught one: the compiler emitted searchAll()/searchAny(), which
# are not ClickHouse functions.
