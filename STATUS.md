## One-paragraph summary

Building a unified infrastructure observability platform — network monitoring, logs,
metrics, traces, flows and topology sharing **one resource identity and one correlation
model**, rather than an NMS bolted to a log stack. Rust/Axum + React, PostgreSQL for the
control plane and ClickHouse for telemetry, OpenTelemetry Collector instead of a bespoke
agent. Both on-premise and hosted are first-class; buyers are unrestricted, including
government and defence, which is why on-prem is not a downgrade. The W1 storage
benchmark is **complete and validated the architecture**, written up at
[`docs/benchmarks/w1.md`](./docs/benchmarks/w1.md).

**Thirteen of the roadmap's fourteen milestones are built**: M0 architecture, M1 core, M2
NMS, M3 logs, M4 metrics and alerting, M5 discovery, M6 topology, M7 flow, M8
observability, M9 incident, M10 automation, M11 security analytics and M12 enterprise. All
five telemetry signals — metrics, logs, events and state, flows, traces — land on **one**
resource identity and are read through **one** query AST, which was the whole bet. **M13 AI
is the only milestone not started**, and PLAN §10 calls it *direction, not commitments*.

> **Found and fixed 2026-09-24 by the EVE-NG lab: nothing walked LLDP.** `uops_discover::neighbours`
> and `PgStore::record_neighbours` are both implemented and tested, and **no running
> process calls them** — `record_neighbours` is invoked only from tests. On a real estate
> `GET /api/v1/topology` returns `nodes: 0, edges: 0`. M5's criterion is reopened to `[~]`
> with the evidence. The lab is four Debian nodes with `lldpd` exporting LLDP-MIB over
> AgentX, confirmed answering by `snmpwalk`; discovery and polling of those same nodes
> work correctly, which is what made the gap specific rather than vague.
>
> **Fixed the same day** — `docs/topology-walk.md`. The poller walks neighbours on its
> discovery task, beside the call that already writes interface `member_of` edges from the
> same transport. The lab now returns the cabled tree: `nodes: 4, edges: 3`, every edge
> `discovered_by: lldp`, and 6 reported adjacencies collapsed to 3 by the sorted pair.

> **Found 2026-09-24 by `scripts/unreached.py`: there is no user administration, and no way
> to create a second tenant.** `create_user`, `grant_role`, `revoke_role`, `disable_user`
> and `set_break_glass` are all implemented and tested — seventeen test files call
> `create_user` — and **no production code calls any of them**. `bootstrap` makes the first
> admin and SSO's `provision` onboards users from group mappings, so every SSO deployment is
> fine; an organization using passwords has one user forever, no installation can disable a
> departing employee or change a role without `psql`, and nobody can change their own
> password. `docs/security-overview.md` and `Role::Admin`'s own doc comment both say an
> admin manages users and roles.
>
> The heavier half is tenancy. The only `INSERT INTO tenant` outside tests is
> `bootstrap.rs:152`, and `bootstrap` runs once — there is no `create_tenant` at all. So a
> running installation has exactly **one** tenant, permanently, and the MSP story
> `security-overview.md` sells (*"admin on one customer and viewer on another"*) is not
> reachable. `TenantScope` is enforced by the type system and asserted across every route in
> `isolation.rs`; production can currently only ever have one side of that boundary.
>
> **Decided, not yet built** — both halves now have a document.
> `docs/user-administration.md` covers users, roles and the account lifecycle, including why
> an admin never sets another person's password and why the last admin cannot be removed.
> `docs/tenant-lifecycle.md` covers creating and retiring a tenant, and found the thing that
> would have made the first successful use of the feature a lockout: creating a tenant raises
> the denominator in `is_org_admin`, so the admin who creates one loses organization-wide
> admin the instant it commits unless the same transaction grants them a role on it — and
> tenant creation requires that admin, so nothing inside the product could repair it.
>
> It also found that the runtime was already built for this — every scheduling loop re-reads
> `all_tenant_ids()` each turn, so a new tenant needs no restart — and that deletion was
> already decided by the schema: of the twenty-seven foreign keys referencing `tenant`,
> nineteen cascade and eight refuse, and the eight are the identity tables. `DELETE FROM
> tenant` already fails on any tenant that ever had a resource. Removal is retirement.
>
> **This is an open gap against M12, which is otherwise complete.**

**One criterion across all thirteen is not met**, and it is not hidden: M12's cross-tenant
isolation, which reopens with every surface a later milestone adds and is currently
satisfied — all 44 registered route paths have a case in `isolation.rs`, the only one
absent being the `/api/{*rest}` fallback, which it exercises as
`/api/v1/no-such-endpoint`. M10's dry run against a real SSH server was the other one and
closed on 2026-09-24; M12's two-poller sample count was measured and closed earlier.

**Two gaps are open that no criterion ever asked about**, both found on 2026-09-24 and both
recorded above: there is no user administration, and no way to create a second tenant. They
are not failed criteria — they are things every criterion about them would have passed,
which is the point.

M12 is the one that changed what the product *is* rather than what it does: it now
survives losing a process, authenticates the way an organisation already does, knows what
collectors it has and notices when one stops, has a restore somebody has actually
performed, and carries the evidence a procurement team asks for.

Against PLAN's own yardstick — *"something valuable exists at month 9"* — the product is
past that line.

| `uops-snmp` | ✅ 42 — walk, simulator, `snmp2` over UDP, real net-snmp |
| `uops-poller` | ✅ 32 — the binary, end to end against real everything |
| interface discovery | ✅ children + `member_of`, matched on name |
| counter wrap → no negative rate | ✅ computed in `ClickHouse` at query time |
| ICMP availability | ✅ unprivileged datagram socket, no capability needed |
| p95 through the binary | ⬜ measured in the library only |
| **M3 · syslog parsing** | ✅ RFC 5424, RFC 3164, RFC 6587 framing |
| **M3 · syslog receivers** | ✅ UDP with drop counting, TCP with backpressure — 46 tests |
| **M3 · normalize + batch** | ✅ syslog → `LogRow` on semconv keys, batched inserts |
| **M3 · `uops-pipeline`** | ✅ resolve + enrich + batch, shared by every collector — 17 tests |
| identity cache hit rate > 99% | ✅ measured, once the resolver stopped asking the wrong question |
| **Resource groups** | ✅ schema, selector, store, five routes — 11 tests against real `PostgreSQL` |
| **Operator tags** | ✅ a column and a type of their own, apart from `attributes` |
| **Maintenance windows** | ✅ model, occurrence arithmetic, five routes — 13 tests against real `PostgreSQL`, 11 on the DST cases |
| M3 · syslog over TLS | ✅ **decided: terminated at a proxy**, not in-process |
| **M3 · the syslog daemon** | ✅ `uops-collector-syslog` — a datagram becomes a queryable row, end to end against real everything |
| **M3 · WAL spill** | ✅ segments on disk, replayed oldest-first, survives a crash |
| **M3 · 50 000 msg/s, drop counter at zero** | ✅ **measured** — 49 986/s offered, all received, 0 dropped, 501 000 rows queryable |
| M3 · ceiling | ✅ **~100 000/s**, twice the target, every overflow datagram counted |
| **M3 · OTLP decoding** | ✅ logs and metrics → the same rows syslog produces — 21 tests |
| **M3 · the OTLP receiver** | ✅ `uops-collector-otlp` — OTLP/HTTP, logs + metrics + traces, end to end |
| **M3 · Log Explorer** | ✅ histogram with drag-to-zoom, field sidebar, row detail, **all signals for a resource** |
| **M3 · live tail** | ✅ `POST /api/v1/query/tail` — half-open on `ingested_at`, so polls partition the rows |
| **M3 · saved searches** | ✅ stored `Query` ASTs — five routes, compiled before they are stored, 11 tests against real `PostgreSQL` |
| **M4 · the alert state machine** | ✅ `ok → pending → firing → resolved`, pure — a flapping signal that would send 600 notifications sends 0 |
| **M4 · rules and state** | ✅ migration 0014, eight routes, dedup by `(tenant, dedup_key)` — 16 tests against real `PostgreSQL` |
| **M4 · a saved search becomes a rule with no edits** | ✅ asserted through HTTP: the rule holds the search's query byte for byte |
| **M4 · the evaluator** | ✅ `uops-alert` — a wheel, not a task per rule; runs inside `uops-server`, verified live |
| **M4 · a flapping signal notifies nobody** | ✅ asserted twice: pure, and end to end against real `ClickHouse` |
| **M4 · absence detects a device going quiet** | ✅ fires once, six minutes after the last sample |
| **M4 · 1 000 rules inside one 60 s cycle** | ✅ **measured — 12.09 s**, p95 331 ms per rule, [`docs/benchmarks/alert-cycle.md`](./docs/benchmarks/alert-cycle.md) |
| **M4 · notifications — webhooks** | ✅ `uops-notify`, delivered from the engine, verified against a real socket |
| **M4 · the rate limit stops a storm** | ✅ SPEC's 5 000-resource rule sends 12 and records 4 988 refusals |
| **M4 · a per-tenant daily budget** | ✅ the backstop behind the rate — a slow leak, not a storm |
| **M4 · notifications — SMTP** | ✅ a smarthost on the deployment's own network. **Authenticated submission is refused by design** — `AUTH PLAIN` without TLS sends a password in clear; put a submission proxy in front of a provider that needs one |
| **M4 · alerts in the web app** | ✅ the alert list with acknowledgement, rules from a saved search, channels and the delivery log |
| **M4 · dashboards** | ✅ five panel types, panels from saved searches, twelve-column grid |
| **M4 · 20 panels over 30 days, p95 < 3 s** | ✅ **measured — 0.42 s**, answered by `metrics_5m`, [`docs/benchmarks/dashboard-load.md`](./docs/benchmarks/dashboard-load.md) |
| **M4 — all 6 acceptance criteria met** | ✅ |
| **UI/UX specification, part 1** | ✅ [`docs/UI-SPEC.md`](./docs/UI-SPEC.md) — the gate `UI.md` §13 sets, for the foundation and the first screen |
| **UI · the Operations Overview** | ✅ four tiles, what is firing, log volume by severity, busiest resources — six panels, four queries |
| **UI · tokens, series palette, focus ring** | ✅ UI-SPEC §1 applied; `--unknown` and `--maintenance` exist at last |
| **UI · the mark** | ✅ letterform-free, so it survives the rename below |
| **UI · installable on any device** | ✅ web app manifest, icons at 192/512/180 — one build, phone home screen to NOC wall. No service worker, deliberately: a console showing cached state is worse than one that says it cannot reach the server |
| UI · a native desktop shell | ⬜ **decided: Tauri, not Electron, and a window rather than a second UI** — [`docs/UI-SPEC.md`](./docs/UI-SPEC.md) §9a |
| **Brand clearance: `Veyronis` has a conflict** | ⬜ **`veyronis.com` is an active software consultancy**, and *Varonis Systems* holds a registered US mark (4592747) in an adjacent field. A rename is likely; the branding rule means it costs documentation, not code |
| Naming: first-pass screen done | ⬜ Rejected on conflicts: *Veyronis*, *Sentryl*, *Lumenwatch*, *Corvane*, *Helvara*. Clear so far: **Northwarden**. A screen is not clearance — the checklist in SPEC's branding rule still applies |
| **M5 — all 12 acceptance criteria met** | ✅ [`docs/M5-discovery.md`](./docs/M5-discovery.md) |
| `uops-discover` · `uops-sweeper` | ✅ CIDR sweep, SNMP classification, LLDP/CDP/ARP neighbours, the scheduler that runs them |
| **M6 · topology** | ✅ the `connected_to` graph, impact analysis, the topology screen — edges are evidence from a device naming its neighbour, never drawn by hand |
| **M7 — all 10 acceptance criteria met** | ✅ [`docs/M7-flow.md`](./docs/M7-flow.md) |
| `uops-flow` | ✅ 83 — NetFlow v5, NetFlow v9, IPFIX and sFlow v5, hand-written, with a structure-aware fuzzer |
| `uops-collector-flow` | ✅ one listener per tenant, template caches per exporter, the flow screen with its `≈` mark |
| **M8 — all 10 acceptance criteria met** | ✅ [`docs/M8-observability.md`](./docs/M8-observability.md) |
| M8 · spans and the service aggregate | ✅ migration 0008 — `spans` keyed on the host, `service_5m` keyed on the service |
| M8 · the OTLP span decoder | ✅ `uops_otlp::traces` — and the identity split that made `service_id` possible at all |
| M8 · the planner learns traces | ✅ `spans` for an investigation, `service_5m` for the APM screen |
| M8 · log↔trace correlation | ✅ one predicate on a column populated since M3, proven end to end through the receiver |
| M8 · the service map | ✅ derived from parent/child spans, with the tenant filtered on **both** sides of the join |
| M8 · the Services screen | ✅ every count named `sampled*`, in the API and in the client |
| **M8 · the two measurements** | ✅ at 100M spans: a trace lookup reads **9–11 granules** against 4 083 without the index, and the service map does an hour in **472–583 ms**. Both bets were right; the bloom filter's false-positive rate was the default and nobody had chosen it — `ch-migrations/0009` |
| M8 · a trace waterfall | ⬜ the queries exist (`uops_query::correlate`) and the API runs them; no screen draws the tree |
| **M9 — 9 of 11 criteria met** | ✅ [`docs/M9-incident.md`](./docs/M9-incident.md) |
| M9 · the Investigation Workspace | ✅ every signal for one resource in one window — the screen PLAN §6 has wanted since M0's sort key was chosen for it |
| M9 · alerts grouped into incidents | ✅ `uops-incident` — the grouping is pure and exhaustively tested; the topology walk is migration 0022 |
| **M9 · the timeline, measured** | ✅ **40 960 rows read against 3 735 552** without the resource predicate at 100M rows — the M0 sort key priced |
| **M12 §2.1 · leases** | ✅ migration 0023 — one `UPDATE`, a row lock for an election, and the same mechanism in the poller, the alert engine and the sweeper. Sixteen processes race for one lease in the tests |
| **M12 §2.2 · single sign-on** | ✅ [`docs/sso.md`](./docs/sso.md) — `uops-oidc` — the authorization-code flow with PKCE, RS256/ES256 verification, and claim-to-role mapping that is configuration rather than inference. 75 unit tests plus 15 against a scripted provider that **actually signs** |
| **M12 §2.2 · requiring SSO** | ✅ an organization may switch off password login for everyone but one named break-glass account, whose every use is an audit event |
| **M12 §2.3 · the collector registry** | ✅ [`docs/collectors.md`](./docs/collectors.md) — migration 0025 — enrol, heartbeat, and an inventory that separates *never reported* from *went quiet*. Four callers: the syslog, OTLP and flow collectors and the poller. The token is an operational control rather than a security boundary, and the doc says why |
| **M12 §2.3 · assignment comes from the server** | ✅ a listener naming a tenant this collector was not assigned refuses to start, naming the tenant. Opt-in: a collector with no token behaves exactly as before |
| **M12 §2.4 · backup and restore** | ✅ `scripts/backup.sh` + `scripts/restore.sh` — two planes, two commands, and a destination that has no default so a rehearsal cannot overwrite production |
| **M12 §2.4 · a drill was performed** | ✅ [`docs/restore-drill.md`](./docs/restore-drill.md) — every telemetry table matched exactly, recovery took **8 s** on this data, and the drill **found a defect a procedure would not have**: restoring with the materialized views attached doubled every aggregate and tripled `metrics_1h`, silently, with every raw table exactly right |
| **M12 §2.4 · the KEK property is a test** | ✅ a restored control plane without its key material lists and names its credentials and opens none of them — `uops-store-pg/tests/restore.rs`, with the paired positive case so the negative one means something |
| **M12 §2.5 · the buyer's evidence** | ✅ [`docs/security-overview.md`](./docs/security-overview.md) and [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md) — dated, naming what it describes, and claiming **no certification**, because claiming one casually is worse than claiming neither |
| **M12 §2.5 · generated, not typed** | ✅ an SBOM and a dependency licence report out of CI, attached to every published release. 300 third-party crates across 18 licence expressions, all permissive — `scripts/licence-report.py` reads `cargo metadata`, so it cannot drift from what cargo builds |
| **M12 — all 12 acceptance criteria addressed** | ✅ ten met, two partial: the two-poller sample count, and cross-tenant isolation which reopens with each new surface |
| **M10 · decisions closed** | ✅ [`docs/M10-automation.md`](./docs/M10-automation.md) — the first milestone that **writes** to a customer's network, so every decision in it is about what stops it |
| **M10 · the rules** | ✅ `uops-runbook` — 59 tests on what the product refuses: a `reload` marked read-only, a destructive step with no declared rollback, a value that could end the command it is substituted into, a run approved by the person who started it |
| **M10 · storage** | ✅ migration 0026 — and three things the *schema* makes unrepresentable rather than checking: a version that changed, one person approving twice, and **approving your own run** |
| **M10 · a transcript is not a credential store** | ✅ `uops_runbook::redact` — redacted in the store on the way in, so no path writes a raw one. A net rather than a boundary, and the module says so at the top |
| **M10 · the runner** | ✅ `uops-runner` — its own binary, because a runbook step is a long, blocking, network-bound operation and putting one on the API's runtime is how a web request queues behind a device that is not answering. Two guards, and only one is the lease: `claim_next_run` is the `UPDATE` that makes a queued run execute exactly once |
| **M10 · the SSH transport** | ✅ `ssh(1)` as a child process — M10 §2.10 records the search that led there: the one maintained async SSH client in Rust offers two crypto backends and both carry the OpenSSL term, which is not on this workspace's allow-list. The key is written to a private file and removed on **every** path, including the timeout |
| **M10 · the API and the screens** | ✅ runbooks, plan, runs, run detail and cancel — approvals that expire while a run queues send it back to *waiting*, not to *failed*, because what went wrong is that ten minutes passed |
| **M10 · a dry run means something** | ✅ and it is the defect this milestone actually found: `runs_in_dry_run` was `!destructive && is_inherently_read_only()`, and an `ssh.command` is never inherently read-only — so a dry run executed nothing and reported success |
| **M10 · verified against a real SSH server** | ✅ **closed 2026-09-24** — `uops-runner/tests/live_ssh.rs` against a real `sshd`, nothing stubbed between the run queue and the remote shell. The read-only step's proof is a per-run marker concatenated with `$(uname -s)`, which only a real shell expands; the destructive step's proof is that the test asks the device **directly**, over a separate `ssh`, whether the file it would create exists. Skipped loudly without `UOPS_SSH_HOST` |
| **M11 · the decisions** | ✅ [`docs/M11-security.md`](./docs/M11-security.md) — **12 of 12 criteria met**. The product ships a vocabulary and the queries, not a detection library: M11 §1 is explicit that detection content is a content business |
| **M11 · `uops-security`** | ✅ 44 tests — ECS field aliasing, four log grammars including CEF, and classification. The CEF header defect is written up rather than quietly fixed: the parser read `SignatureID` as the event name |
| **M11 · security is not a separate product** | ✅ a firewall deny and a link going down are the same question, so the screen sits under Operations and M9's suppression rules apply to detections unchanged — asserted by mixing the two in one incident |
| **Objectives (SLOs)** | ✅ [`docs/slo.md`](./docs/slo.md) — migration 0029. A ratio over `service_5m`, which has carried `requests` and `errors` since M8, so again no new collection. **The product does not print a remaining error count**: traces are sampled, a ratio over a sample estimates the true ratio and is sound, and a count needs a denominator this product does not know. 28 tests |
| **Objectives · availability is deliberately absent** | ⬜ and the reason was already written: the Overview refuses to draw a health percentage because availability with maintenance windows excluded has no defensible formula yet. An availability SLO is that number with a target attached |
| **Addresses (IPAM)** | ✅ [`docs/ipam.md`](./docs/ipam.md) — migration 0028, one table. Everything else is derived from what the product already collected: `resource_identifier` for addresses something claims, `discovery_candidate` for addresses that merely answered. **Assigned and responding are two numbers on purpose** — an address that answered and that nothing claims is the finding, and summing them would throw it away. 20 tests |
| **Addresses · the arithmetic the textbook gets wrong** | ✅ `2^(32-masklen) - 2` returns 0 for a /31 and −1 for a /32, and a routed estate is full of both. The capacity function lives beside the table and handles them |
| **The trace waterfall** | ✅ the screen M8 closed without — `web/src/trace.ts`, `tracepage.tsx`. No backend work, exactly as M8 predicted. Refuses an empty trace id, because `trace_id` is `''` on every syslog line in the estate and a blank one would render the tenant's whole log history under "logs from this trace" |
| **The Overview says what is arriving** | ✅ six cheap aggregates that separate *nothing is wrong* from *nothing is arriving* — the state every other panel on that screen makes look **better** as it gets worse |
| **M11 · the product watches itself** | ✅ [`docs/self-monitoring.md`](./docs/self-monitoring.md) + migration 0027 — the installation is a resource, so a sign-in is an ordinary `authentication` event and a detection over it is an ordinary rule. The event write is **spawned off the request path**, because doing it inline reintroduced an account-enumeration timing oracle that a test caught |

## Resume in three commands

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ratul-netizen/veyronis && cd veyronis
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d postgres clickhouse
bash scripts/db.sh migrate && bash scripts/ch.sh apply

# On the machine this was last built on there is no Docker. Bring both databases up the
# way docs/dev-environment.md describes instead, then set CLICKHOUSE_URL to the VM.
# uops-store-pg reads DATABASE_URL and refuses to guess one, so the suite is short by
# about eighty tests without it — and they fail with instructions rather than passing.
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://uops:uops@localhost:5432/uops
export CLICKHOUSE_USER=uops CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD=uops
cargo test --workspace --all-targets && cargo test --workspace --doc   # 1 400+ tests, green
cd web && npm ci && npm test                                            # 160 more
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

To bring the benchmark stack back (only needed to re-run W1):

```bash
docker compose -f bench/docker-compose.yml up -d     # ClickHouse 26.8, data persists in a volume
bash bench/scripts/load.sh logs 10000000 --truncate  # ~3 min
bash bench/scripts/run.sh 5                          # query suite → bench/results/

The benchmark data is **regenerable, never committed**. Seed 42 reproduces it exactly.

## The five decisions that everything else follows from

1. **Resource identity + correlation is the product.** Storage, polling and ingestion are
   commodities. When `router-01` appears in SNMP, syslog, NetFlow, LLDP, a config backup
   and an alert, all six must resolve to one `resource_id`. Everything downstream depends
   on it.
2. **Two storage engines, not four.** PostgreSQL (control) + ClickHouse (telemetry).
   ClickHouse full-text search went GA March 2026, so logs, metrics, traces and flows
   live in one engine. Rejected: OpenSearch (~10x nodes at log volume), Quickwit
   (Datadog-owned since Jan 2025), TimescaleDB for metrics (557K→159K rows/s at 10M hosts).
3. **OpenTelemetry Collector, not a bespoke agent.** It already does host metrics, files,
   journald, Windows Event Log and syslog.
4. **Both deployment models, customer's choice.** Two named profiles, `onprem` and
   `hosted`, each selecting a coherent set of implementations — not a pile of config flags.
5. **AGPL-3.0 + CLA.** AGPL blocks a hosted clone; the CLA keeps commercial
   dual-licensing available for on-prem buyers whose legal teams block AGPL outright.

---

## W1 results — the numbers that justify the architecture

ClickHouse 26.8.2.7, single node, warm cache. The written verdict is
[`docs/benchmarks/w1.md`](./docs/benchmarks/w1.md); the raw evidence behind it is
[`bench/results/FINDINGS.md`](./bench/results/FINDINGS.md).

### The core bet, confirmed

**Q05 — "all signals for one resource in a window" — ran at 9 ms reading 16,380 rows at
BOTH 10M and 100M.** Ten times the data, identical latency, identical work. Resource-scoped
investigation is independent of table size. **The sort key
`(tenant_id, resource_id, observed_at)` must not change.**

Selective token search behaves the same way: 8,190 rows read at both scales to find one
hit in a hundred million.

### What the benchmark changed in the spec

| Finding | Amendment |
|---|---|
| Tail query read the **entire tenant** (2,303 ms) | `p_by_time` projection → **72 ms, 254 K rows. 32x.** Cost ~1.9x storage |
| Explorer histogram at 1,066 ms, and the projection **does not fix it** (rows read barely moved) | Pre-aggregated `logs_counts_5m`. Re-renders on every search, so it matters more than the tail |
| Slowest query was `GROUP BY attributes['host.name']` at **2,252 ms** — worse than phrase search | Materialize grouped semconv attributes as real columns |
| Text index = **71% of compressed data**, and the overhead *grew* with scale | Per-source opt-out is **required**, not optional |
| `LIKE` 1,928 ms, phrase 2,378 ms, both full scans | No index-accelerated substring or phrase search. `QueryWarning` in the AST |

Also learned: time-ordering compresses **58% worse** than resource-ordering, because
sorting by resource groups rows sharing vendor/source/host.

### Harness artifacts — not ClickHouse numbers

Recorded so nobody mistakes them for storage limits later:
`docker exec -i` stdin load was **18x slower** than HTTP (182 s vs 9.9 s per 1M rows), and
`curl --data-binary @-` buffers the whole stream — it hit 6.7 GB RSS climbing toward
~32 GB before being killed. Loads now run in bounded batches.

crates/uops-store-pg/src/identity.rs
   IdentityStore over PostgreSQL. Merge and split are one transaction each:
   half a merge orphans every row of telemetry under the old resource_id.

crates/uops-store-pg/src/discovery.rs
   What a discovery walk becomes: child resources and member_of edges, in one
   transaction. Does NOT go through identity resolution — an interface's parent
   is not in question, so resolving it would mean manufacturing a confidence
   score for a fact and putting interfaces in the review queue because two
   switches both have a Gi0/1. Identifiers are attached, because a flow record
   or an LLDP neighbour arrives later with a MAC and nothing else.

crates/uops-poller/
   The polling binary. main.rs is the order things happen in; the pieces are
   config (no default KEK — a poller that cannot open a credential polls
   nothing, so it refuses to start naming the variable), credentials (one
   UdpTransport per credential, not per device), fleet (rows to devices; the
   crossing between tenants is a visible `for` loop, because TenantScope has
   no "all tenants" and should not), poll (request, convert, write) and run
   (the loop, and what it says when a device fails).
   Proven end to end in tests/live.rs: a device in PostgreSQL, polled over
   real SNMP against the net-snmp container, becoming rows in ClickHouse.

crates/uops-store-pg/src/sealed.rs
   SealedStore over the credential table. Until now every credential in the
   system lived in MemorySealedStore and did not survive a restart, which the
   poller cannot work with. Sees no plaintext: the wrapping is LocalVault's and
   the KEK is KekRing's, neither reachable from this file. SealedStore is
   synchronous and sqlx is not, so exactly one file pays for the bridge
   (block_in_place), in the place that chose it.
```

CI enforces fmt, clippy `-D warnings`, tests, doctests, plus: a grep that fails the build
if `.expose()` appears inside a logging macro; a grep that fails if a crypto primitive is
used outside `uops-secrets`; `cargo-deny`; a CycloneDX SBOM; and a matrix building **both**
the standard and FIPS crypto artifacts.

### UDP and TCP fail in opposite directions

They are written separately rather than behind one transport abstraction, because the
right behaviour under load is the opposite in each.

**UDP cannot push back.** A datagram that arrives with nowhere to go is gone, and the
sender will never know or retry. So the receiver drops it and *counts* it — SPEC: *"a
silently dropping syslog receiver is worse than none"*. It uses `try_send` rather than
`send` for exactly this: awaiting a full channel would stop reading the socket, and the
kernel would then drop the rest of the burst invisibly, which is the outcome SPEC is
warning about. Dropping in userspace is visible; dropping in the kernel is not.

**TCP can push back.** Not reading makes the receive window shrink, which makes the
sender slow down. So it uses `send` and waits. A TCP receiver that dropped under load
would be discarding something it could simply have taken more slowly.

What the drop counter does *not* include is datagrams the kernel discarded before this
process saw them. Those need `SO_RXQ_OVFL` and a `recvmsg` with control messages, which
is Linux-only and is not wired up. What is done instead is the half SPEC names: `SO_RCVBUF`
is raised explicitly, and **what the kernel actually granted is reported** — Linux caps
the request at `net.core.rmem_max`, which on a stock install is 208 KiB against the 8 MiB
asked for. A receiver that asked for 8 MB, silently got 208 KB and reported success would
be precisely the silent dropping the requirement exists to prevent.

### Putting the poller in compose was three pieces, not one

The plan was to copy a binary into the image and add a service. What that would have
produced is a poller logging "no credential is assigned" for every device for ever,
because **nothing in the product could create a credential**. The `credential` table had
existed since migration 0005 and had only ever been written by a test.

Then, with credentials possible, a device still could not be polled: `pollable_devices`
reads `resource_identifier` where `kind = 'mgmt_ip'`, deliberately — an address is what
identity resolution matches on rather than a column on the device — and no route could
write one. So the chain needed a third piece.

The result is that the path from `docker compose up` to a device being polled is now
four API calls, and it is in the README because nothing else would make it discoverable.

Two decisions inside that:

**Material goes in and never comes out.** No route returns a credential's material — not
for an administrator, not for an export, not for a "reveal" button. The value of envelope
encryption is that the material has one reader, and every additional path to it is one a
compromised session or a screenshot can take. `NewMaterial` and `CreateCredential` carry
hand-written `Debug` impls that redact, because a derived one puts a community string in
the first `{:?}` anybody reaches for.

**Manual identifiers are replaced wholesale and discovered ones are untouched.** One verb
gives add, change and remove — a route that only added would make a mistyped `mgmt_ip`
permanent, and a mistyped management address is a device polling somebody else's
equipment. The `source` column separates what an operator asserted from what a collector
observed, and an operator editing the inventory has no business deleting the evidence
identity resolution merged two resources on.

### The KEK is generated, not committed

`docker compose up` generates one into a named volume on first run. A key in a repository
is a key in every clone, every fork and every CI log, and the one certain thing about a
convenient development default is that somebody ships it.

The API and the poller read the same file. A credential the API sealed that the poller
cannot open is a device that silently never gets polled, which is the worst way for this
to be misconfigured — so there is one file and both mount it read-only.

`down` keeps the volume; `down -v` destroys it and with it the ability to decrypt every
stored credential. That is the only way to say it on purpose.

### Two inconsistencies the isolation harness found

Both were routes answering something other than 404 for another tenant's object, and
neither leaked anything — which is why they had survived.

`PgSealedStore::revoke` returned `Ok` however many rows it touched, so revoking another
tenant's credential answered **204**. `MemorySealedStore` had always reported `NotFound`;
the PostgreSQL implementation was the outlier, and an API built on it told an operator
"done" about something it had not touched.

`identifiers_for` returned **200 `[]`** for another tenant's resource — the same answer
as a resource with no identifiers, so no information crossed, but a 200 says "this exists
and is empty" where every other resource route says "not found".

The harness caught both only because it now builds its `AppState` with a real vault.
Without one the credential routes answer 503 before the scope check, and the test would
have been checking that a disabled feature leaks nothing.

### The map does not use tiles

A tile layer means a tile server. This product is deployed on-premise and often
air-gapped — the same argument `uops-oui` makes about the IEEE registry — so a map that
fetched tiles would be a blank rectangle for exactly the customers most likely to have
forty sites across a country. It would also send every viewer's map extent to a third
party, which is a data-protection conversation nobody wants to have about a status board.

So the coastline is Natural Earth's 110m land outline, converted by `scripts/worldmap.py`
into one SVG path and bundled: 54 KB, about 20 KB gzipped, no network. Natural Earth is
public domain and states that no permission or credit is required, which is a materially
different position from the IEEE registry beside it.

The cost is that this is a *locator* map — coastlines, no roads, no labels, no zoom into
a street. For "which of my forty sites is red" that is the whole requirement.

Equirectangular, because `x = lon + 180` and `y = 90 - lat` in a 360×180 viewBox means
the browser needs no projection code and the pins are positioned by the same arithmetic
as the coastline. A projection the pins and the map disagreed about would put every site
slightly in the sea, and slightly is the hardest kind of wrong to notice.

### Where a site is, and why not where a device is

Coordinates are on `site`, not on `resource`: fifty switches in one building are not
fifty places, and a coordinate per device is the same two numbers fifty times, invited to
disagree.

Not derived from an IP address either. Geo-IP answers a different question and for this
product usually answers nothing — a management address is RFC 1918 and resolves nowhere,
a public one resolves to whoever registered the block. An operator typing a coordinate
once per site is more accurate than a lookup that is wrong invisibly.

A pin's colour is worst-first and deliberately not a proportion: one device down out of
two hundred is still an outage for whoever depends on it, and a pin that faded to amber
because the other hundred and ninety-nine were fine would be hiding it. The size of the
problem is in the numbers on the card.

### The OUI table reads all four IEEE registries

A 24-bit prefix is what everybody means by "the OUI", and it is 39 815 of 53 487
assignments. The other 13 672 are MA-M (28-bit) and MA-S (36-bit) blocks, issued to
organisations that do not need sixteen million addresses — in practice, most companies
that are not household names.

The first draft of that module's documentation said a 24-bit-only lookup would return the
*wrong* vendor, the one holding the parent block. The data disagrees: IEEE reserves the
parent prefixes above the MA-M and MA-S ranges and does not list them in the MA-L
registry, so the answer is nothing rather than somebody else. Checked before it was
written down, and worth recording because the wrong version was the intuitive one.

A locally administered address — every VM, veth, bond and VLAN interface — belongs to
nobody, and returning a manufacturer for one would be inventing it. A CID is returned
with a flag saying it is not a uniqueness guarantee, because an inventory wants it and
identity resolution must not treat it as proof.

### A serial number is what identity resolution was missing

SPEC §M0.2 ranks identifiers by how much a match proves: a serial is tier 1, confidence
1.00, proof on its own; a management address is 0.80 and a hostname 0.65. Nothing in this
product produced a tier-1 identifier for an SNMP device, so resolution had been running
entirely on the weak tiers — two collectors seeing one switch resolved to one resource
only if they agreed about its address or its name, and a re-addressed device looked new.

The profile's `identity` block is what fixes that, and it is a block rather than code
because every vendor puts its model number at a different OID and a customer discovers
that before we do.

### The simulator modelled a GET as a GETNEXT

Found by a profile reading `entPhysicalSoftwareRev`, the first column of ENTITY-MIB's
chassis row. Every other fact came back and that one never did — against the simulator.
The real transport returned all five.

`Transport::get_scalars`' default implementation is a `GETNEXT` per OID, which is what a
transport with no batching can do, and it cannot return the lowest OID of a contiguous
block because nothing precedes it to ask after. `sim::Fleet` now implements a `GET` as a
`GET`. A simulator that models a request as a different request hides exactly the bugs it
exists to catch.

### Six tests that passed on Windows and failed on Linux

`KekRing::from_file` refuses a group- or world-readable key on Unix — rightly, since a
KEK other local accounts can read is not a root of trust — and `std::fs::write` leaves
`0644`. Two test fixtures wrote a KEK that way. On Windows the check does not apply and
they passed; on Linux, which is where CI runs, all six sealed-credential tests failed.

They had been failing since they were written and nothing said so, because the suite had
only ever been run on Windows. Found by running the whole workspace in a Linux container
while verifying ICMP — which is worth doing before any commit touching anything
platform-sensitive, not just that one.

### ICMP needs no capability

`SOCK_DGRAM` + `IPPROTO_ICMP`, not a raw socket. `CAP_NET_RAW` would also permit forging
arbitrary packets and putting an interface into promiscuous mode, granted to the whole
process for the life of the container — a large grant for a ping.

The unprivileged socket is gated by `net.ipv4.ping_group_range`, and Docker sets that to
`0 2147483647` on its default bridge. Verified in a container, as root and as uid 1000,
rather than assumed. A container run with `--network host` inherits the host namespace
instead, where the range is usually closed; CI runs on a VM and sets the sysctl in a
named step, which is also where the deployment requirement is written down so it cannot
drift from the code.

Where the sysctl is narrowed, the check reports which sysctl to widen rather than
reporting every device as down — the distinction `CheckError` exists to make, because a
poller that cannot open a socket looks exactly like a catastrophic outage.

### Rates are computed in `ClickHouse`, not in Rust

`uops_poll::counter` states the wrap rule and is thoroughly tested, and nothing executes
it on a query path — which is why the criterion sat unmet while looking done. SPEC says
rates are computed at query time from the raw series, and doing that in Rust would mean
shipping every raw point to the API: a 30-day dashboard panel is millions of rows to
compute a few hundred. So `Field::Rate` compiles to a window function.

Reading `counter.rs` closely gives the simplification the SQL is built on: **width and
the timing window decide only what a backwards step is called** — `Wrapped` or `Reset` —
and neither ever produces a number. So the condition a query needs is just "forwards, or
nothing", and nothing in the SQL has to know whether a counter is 32-bit.

Three things that are easy to get wrong and are each asserted:

* A series is one resource's one metric with **one set of labels**. Partition by less and
  two interfaces' counters are differenced against each other, which produces a
  plausible number rather than an error.
* The predicates go **inside** the window subquery. Outside, the window would run over
  the whole table before filtering — and would compute one customer's frames over
  another's rows.
* The **first row of a series** has no rate. `lagInFrame` returns the column default when
  there is no previous row — zero for a `Float64`, the epoch for a `DateTime64` — and the
  arithmetic accepts both, giving a plausible rate over fifty-six years.

A rate over a rollup is refused. A rollup stores the *average* of a counter per bucket,
and the difference between two averages of a monotonic counter is a number that is not a
rate of anything. That one was found by a test written expecting the refusal: rollup
aggregations are chosen by function, so `avg` became `avgMerge(avg_v)` and the field was
never consulted.

### Two found by the test suite racing itself

**A KEK rotation could destroy a credential.** `rotate_kek` read a row, unwrapped its
DEK, re-wrapped it under the new key and wrote the wrapping back — unconditionally. If
the credential was rotated in between (`put` reuses the id, so a rotation replaces the
row's DEK and ciphertext), the row ended up wrapping the *old* DEK over the *new*
ciphertext. Unwrapping yields a key that decrypts nothing, and the credential is
permanently unopenable with no error anywhere until somebody tries to use it.

Found as an intermittent `Open` in a test that had nothing to do with KEK rotation: the
rotation test re-wraps every row in the database, deliberately, and raced the credential
rotation in a neighbouring test. `replace_wrapping` is a compare-and-set now — one
statement, `WHERE id = $1 AND wrapped_dek = $5`, so there is no window between the check
and the write — and returns `Rewrapped::Superseded` rather than pretending it wrote.
Counted separately from `failed` in the report, because nothing went wrong: the row is
newer than the rotation, and the next rotation picks it up.

**Fixtures outside the retention TTL.** `the_explorer_histogram_is_served_from_the_pre_aggregate`
failed about one run in fifteen with an empty result. The ClickHouse fixtures were dated
`1_700_000_000` — 2023-11-14 — and every table they write to has a retention TTL
(`metrics` 30 days, the rest 365). The rows were inserted and then removed by a
background TTL merge, so whether a test passed depended on whether that merge had run
against its part yet. A `SELECT` at the time found 335 rows still in `logs` for that
window and zero in `logs_counts_5m`.

Both fixtures are anchored to now and truncated to a five-minute boundary, and each file
carries `the_fixtures_are_inside_every_retention_window` — a plain assertion with no
timing in it, so the day somebody writes a fixed timestamp again it fails on the first
run rather than once a fortnight.

### Trap worth remembering

The `compile_fail` doctests asserting `Secret<T>` is not serialisable were initially
**not running at all** — rustdoc does not collect doctests from private items inside
`#[cfg(test)]` modules, so they passed vacuously. They now live on the public items.
A security invariant asserted in a test that never executes is worse than no test,
because it reads as covered.

## Next, in dependency order

1. ~~**M8's two measurements.**~~ Done —
   [`bench/results/m8-spans-100000000rows.md`](./bench/results/m8-spans-100000000rows.md).
   Both bets held. The one thing that did not was a *parameter*: `bloom_filter` with no
   argument takes ClickHouse's default false-positive rate of 0.025, so the lookup read a
   hundred granules of false positives around the five it wanted. `bloom_filter(0.001)`
   reads nine, for one per cent more storage — `ch-migrations/0009_spans_trace_index.sql`.

   The measurement trap is worth carrying to the next benchmark: **ClickHouse remembers
   which granules matched a predicate**, so the median of five runs measures that memory
   and not the index. The first version of the harness reported an identical, plausible,
   wrong number for every configuration including no index at all.

2. **A trace waterfall.** The last piece of M8 that is a feature rather than a number,
   and it needs **nothing new from the backend**: `uops_query::correlate` already builds
   the three queries (the spans of a trace, the logs during it, the children of a span)
   and `POST /api/v1/query` already runs them. The Services screen answers *which
   service*; this answers *what was this one request waiting for*.

3. **The review queue still has no way to say "no".** Unchanged since it was found, and
   it has outlived three milestones. A case leaves the queue only when the provisional is
   merged away, so an operator who decides two resources are genuinely *different* has no
   action to take and the question returns tomorrow. It needs a dismissal — a decision
   outcome, a store method and a route — and it is a product decision about what "not the
   same" means for a provisional that already has telemetry attached.

4. **No UI for the review queue.** `pending_reviews` exists and is tested; nothing
   surfaces it. Blocked on the above, because a queue you can only agree with is worse
   than no queue.

5. **M10, M11 and M12 are done**, and what they leave behind is two honest partials
   rather than a tick: **M10's dry run has not been verified against a real SSH server**,
   and cross-tenant isolation reopens with each new surface. M12's two-poller sample count
   was measured and is closed. **M13 AI is the only milestone not started.** See
   [`docs/M10-automation.md`](./docs/M10-automation.md),
   [`docs/M11-security.md`](./docs/M11-security.md) and
   [`docs/M12-enterprise.md`](./docs/M12-enterprise.md).

6. **Product direction now has its own documents**, separate from the milestones:
   [`docs/PRODUCT-STRATEGY.md`](./docs/PRODUCT-STRATEGY.md) is the staged product-family
   plan, and [`docs/COMPETITIVE-POSITION.md`](./docs/COMPETITIVE-POSITION.md) is the
   competitor mapping it rests on. Neither changes the architecture.

### Carried forward, still true

* ~~**The poller has no lease.**~~ **Fixed** — M12 §2.1, migration 0023. All three
  schedulers take a PostgreSQL lease, and two instances of any of them elect exactly one
  owner. What is still *not* measured is the version of the claim that cannot be argued
  with: two real pollers producing one sample per interval, counted rather than reasoned
  about.
* **An interface that stops appearing is left alone.** Deleting it would orphan the
  telemetry that references it, and one missed walk is not proof a port was removed.
  `last_seen` stops advancing; acting on it is a product decision.
* **Availability is not checked inside the poller binary.** `generic-snmp` asks for ICMP,
  which needs a privilege this process should not hold by default. The job is scheduled
  and counted as unsupported rather than silently succeeding — a check that always
  "passed" would report every device permanently up.

## M2 acceptance criteria, where they actually stand

| SPEC §M2 | State |
|---|---|
| 1 000 simulated agents at 60s, p95 < 5 s, no missed cycles | Met in `uops-poll`'s fleet test, against the simulator. **Not** re-measured through the binary |
| SNMPv3 authPriv SHA-256/AES-256 against a real device, credential through `SecretStore` with an access-log entry | Met. `tests/agent.rs` for the wire, `tests/live.rs` for the credential path. The access-log entry is written but the log is in-memory — the `credential_access` table is M3 |
| Interface discovery creates child resources **and** `member_of` relationships | Met. Asserted against the real agent in `tests/live.rs` — the container's `eth0` and `lo` become resources with edges — and two CI mutations require the suite to fail: one writes the wrong edge kind, one breaks the rediscovery key |
| A 32-bit counter wrap produces no negative rate in any query | Met. `Field::Rate` compiles to a window over each series in `ClickHouse`; a backwards step yields `NULL`, which the aggregates skip. Asserted against real `ClickHouse` with a real wrap, and CI breaks the guard and requires the suite to fail — unguarded, the fixture reports −71 582 754 B/s |
| An unknown-vendor device gets interfaces and availability via `generic-snmp` | Met. Interfaces become resources; the ICMP check runs over an **unprivileged datagram socket**, so no `CAP_NET_RAW`. Verified on Linux against a real container — a state transition lands in `states` and in `resource.status` |
| Dead device does not delay healthy devices (measured, not assumed) | Met at both levels. `uops-poll`'s fleet test measures the executor; the scale test measures the loop above it, which is a different claim — a lock held across an await in the loop would serialise the fleet with the executor entirely innocent. Healthy p95 270 ms; with 100 silent devices, 258 ms. Guarded in CI by a mutation that serialises the executor |

## How to pick this up

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d          # postgres + clickhouse
bash scripts/db.sh migrate && bash scripts/db.sh test      # 22 schema invariants
bash scripts/ch.sh apply && bash scripts/ch.sh verify      # 8 migrations, 14 golden
DATABASE_URL=postgres://uops:uops@localhost:5432/uops   CLICKHOUSE_USER=uops CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD=uops   bash scripts/serve.sh                                      # http://127.0.0.1:8080
DATABASE_URL=postgres://uops:uops@localhost:5432/uops   CLICKHOUSE_USER=uops CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD=uops   cargo test --workspace --all-targets                     # 1 242, all green
```

The integration tests need both containers. The unit tests do not, and the workspace
builds with no database at all — `.sqlx/` holds the recorded query metadata.

**The resource model is now settled** — it is in PostgreSQL, in `uops-core`, and in the
ClickHouse sort key. The frontend and the collectors were held back until it was, and
M1 is where they start.

## Open items

| Item | Blocks | Note |
|---|---|---|
| **Shared-database contamination** | intermittent local failures | **Recurred, larger.** The development database had accumulated **2 608 tenants** from every integration test that ever panicked before its clean-up. Harmless until the poller existed; now a reload reads *every* tenant and issues two queries each, so an unswept database turned one reload into five thousand round trips and the live poller test from 2.6 s into 29 s. `db.sh sweep` now removes every tenant but `default` and everything under it, and the poller's live test takes its own scratch database rather than sharing. Earlier instance: the scale test seeded 10 000 resources and did not remove them; four runs left 40 400 rows in the database every other suite shares, which changes what the planner chooses for all of them. It cleans up after itself now, and `db.sh sweep` removes what an interrupted run leaves. This is the likely cause of the "one unreproduced failure" recorded earlier — both occurrences followed scale-test runs. Not proven, because it has not recurred since the purge |
| **Row-level security** | M1 API | Tenant isolation currently rests on `TenantScope`, composite foreign keys and sqlx. RLS would be a fourth layer and is worth having, but it needs an app role and a per-transaction `SET LOCAL` — a decision about connection pooling and the request lifecycle, so it belongs with the API |
| **Credential rollback vs. the primary key** | rotation being undoable | Migration 0005 says "rotation writes a new row rather than overwriting one … a rotation that turns out to be wrong is undone by revoking a row". Neither implementation does that: `LocalVault::put` reuses the credential's id, so both `PgSealedStore` (upsert on id) and `MemorySealedStore` (a map keyed by id) *replace* the previous version. The previous material is gone and revoking leaves nothing to fall back to. Reconciling them is a choice — keep the stable id so `resource.credential_ref` survives a rotation and drop the rollback claim, or key on `(id, version)` and make every reference resolve a version — so it is recorded rather than patched over in one implementation |
| **The bundled IEEE data's terms** | a commercial release | `crates/uops-oui/data/assignments.tsv` is derived from the four public IEEE registries. They are redistributed widely — Wireshark, nmap and Debian's `ieee-data` all ship them — which is the basis for bundling. It is **not** a licence review: IEEE attaches no SPDX identifier, and `cargo deny` checks crate licences rather than the terms of embedded data, so nothing in CI is looking at this |
| **CLA reviewed by a lawyer** | publicising the repository | The licence is decided — AGPL-3.0-only plus a CLA, see *Decided* below — and this is what is left of it. `CLA.md` is a working draft modelled on the Apache ICLA and nobody qualified has read it. **The only irreversible item in this table**: the licence choice can be changed, but one unsigned outside contribution permanently forecloses dual-licensing, because relicensing would need that person's individual consent forever |
| Buyer focus: MSP-first? | credential scoping depth in M1 | My recommendation was MSP-first; your read on Bangladesh/SEA overrides mine |
| Metrics + rollup ingest cost | M4, not M0 | The one W1 measurement not run |
| **Many tenants rather than many rules** | a hosted deployment | The alert cycle is measured at 1 000 rules in **one** tenant. The suppression cache is per tenant, so a thousand tenants read a thousand maintenance maps a cycle rather than one — a different constant, and an unmeasured one. `docs/benchmarks/alert-cycle.md` says what it does not cover |
| **`Pipeline::attribute` mints a resource per call on an empty identity** | nothing today | An `ObservedIdentity` with no identifiers goes straight to `create_for`, so a caller that resolved one per request would fill an inventory with them. Found while splitting the OTLP host and service identities; `uops-collector-otlp` routes around it and returns the nil resource instead. No other caller can reach it — syslog always has a source address — but the hazard is in the shared pipeline rather than in the collector that noticed it |
| **A trace id is shaped exactly like a UUID** | handled, recorded | 32 hex characters is a UUID without its dashes, and the AST's `Value` is `untagged`, so one off the wire deserialises as `Value::Uuid` and would bind as `{p:UUID}` against a `String` column. The compiler now binds by the *column*. Worth keeping visible because it was already wrong for `logs.trace_id`, which has been a `String` since M3 — nothing hit it because there were no spans to look up |
| **No Docker on the development machine** | the documented bring-up | The hypervisor is off for a nested virtualisation stack, so `docker compose` cannot run here. PostgreSQL runs portable and `ClickHouse` runs in a VM — [`docs/dev-environment.md`](./docs/dev-environment.md). The dev `ClickHouse` is deliberately left on a **non-UTC** timezone, because that is what exposed the `DateTime64(3)` parameter bug that returned an empty window silently |
| **Tiered storage policy** | deployment profiles | SPEC §M0.6 shows `TTL … TO VOLUME 'warm'/'cold'` against a `tiered` policy that does not exist on a default install — those migrations would fail outright. Retention is a plain `DELETE` TTL for now; tiering is a later migration, written alongside the profile that configures the policy |

## Decided since the last update

**The Log Explorer, and the interaction SPEC says is the whole product.**

Four things, and one of them matters more than the other three:

* a **histogram** over the same filter as the rows, with drag-to-zoom;
* a **field sidebar** counting the top values of each low-cardinality column, clickable
  into a filter;
* a **row detail** panel showing every column;
* and **"show all signals for this resource around this timestamp"** — SPEC's own words
  for it are *"the seed of the Investigation Workspace, and the one interaction that
  demonstrates the product thesis in ten seconds."*

That last one is four range reads on `(tenant_id, resource_id, observed_at)` — logs,
events, states and metrics — centred on the clicked row's own timestamp rather than the
page's window. It is cheap enough to run on a click **because of decisions made in M0 and
held since**: one `resource_id` for every signal, and every telemetry table sorted the
same way. A product that had let syslog and SNMP and OTLP each keep their own notion of a
host would need four searches here instead of four seeks, and this would be a button
somebody had to mean rather than a click.

**Three queries, one filter.** The rows, the histogram and each sidebar facet are all
*derived* from the single `Query` that was run — `toHistogram`, `toFieldCounts` — because
a histogram that filtered differently from the rows beneath it would be a chart of
something else and nobody would notice until they counted the bars.

**The histogram fills empty buckets.** `ClickHouse` returns a row only for a bucket with
data, so a gap in the result is a gap in *time*; packing the returned buckets side by side
would draw a quiet hour and a busy hour at the same width and make the drag mean something
other than it looks like. SVG, no chart library — the same call `map.tsx` made, for the
same reason: a bar has to be the bucket it claims to be.

**The sidebar is deliberately low-cardinality.** Severity, source, vendor, and the two
*materialised* attributes `host.name` and `service.name`. A facet over `resource_id` would
ask `ClickHouse` to group ten thousand values to show eight, which is exactly the
high-cardinality grouping cost W1 measured and warned about.

**And a bug that green TypeScript could not have caught.** The client's bucket sizing
returned two-day and seven-day widths for long windows, and `uops_query`'s compiler
rejects anything outside one second to one day — so the histogram would have been a **400
on any range past about two months**, with the types perfectly satisfied. Found by reading
the compiler rather than by running the app.

The fix is a clamp; the *lesson* is a test. There are now four tests in `uops-api`'s
`query_route` that post the exact shapes the Explorer sends — the histogram, the bucket
bound, the field counts, and grouping on a materialised attribute — because a
hand-written TypeScript mirror of an AST typechecks against itself and says nothing about
whether the server accepts it.

**The OTLP receiver, and a bug that had already shipped.**

`uops-collector-otlp` speaks OTLP/HTTP on `/v1/logs`, `/v1/metrics` and `/v1/traces`, with
the same tenant-per-listener attribution, the same pipeline, the same batcher and the same
spill as the syslog daemon. Five live tests against real `PostgreSQL` and real
`ClickHouse`.

**The batcher and the spill are now generic over the row type,** because metrics deserve
the same durability logs get — a `ClickHouse` outage loses a metric exactly as permanently
as it loses a log. Two batchers, because they write different tables; **not** one per
tenant, because a batcher exists to make inserts few and large and splitting by tenant
would divide every batch by the number of customers.

The spill's segments do not record their row type, so logs and metrics get **separate
directories**. That is met structurally rather than by a check: a different path is simply
not the same place, where a tag in the file would be a runtime error.

**Backpressure is where OTLP differs from syslog.** The handler waits on a bounded
channel, which becomes the exporter waiting on its HTTP response — which is what HTTP is
for. Nothing is dropped and nothing gets a 429; telling a collector to go away and come
back is worse than making it wait. UDP had no such back channel, which is why the syslog
receiver drops and counts instead.

**Partial success is used properly.** OTLP defines a `rejected_*` count and an error
message in every export response, and a receiver that converted nine records of ten and
answered `200 {}` would be lying by omission. Histograms, summaries and timestamp-less
data points are counted and *named* in the response, so an operator whose latency
histograms never appear learns it from their own collector's logs rather than from an
absent chart three weeks later. Traces are accepted, counted and discarded — with a
message saying so, because *"not stored yet"* and *"the endpoint is broken"* must not look
identical from the outside.

**The bug: `uops-collector-syslog` was never in the Docker image.** The compose service
had named `/usr/local/bin/uops-collector-syslog` as its entrypoint for two commits while
the Dockerfile did not copy it. `docker compose config` validated — the YAML was correct —
and the container would have exited instantly with *no such file*. The compose smoke test
did not catch it because it only waits for `server`.

Both collectors are in the image now, verified by building it and listing
`/usr/local/bin`. And there is a CI guard that greps every `/usr/local/bin/...` entrypoint
out of the compose file and requires each to exist in the built image — read from the
compose file rather than listed, so a service added next year is checked without anybody
remembering to.

What let it through is worth naming: the edit was applied by a script whose pattern did
not match, and which reported success from a *different* substitution in the same run.
A script that edits several things and prints one "ok" cannot say which of them happened.

**And the retention trap, for the third time.** The new live fixtures were dated
`1_700_000_000` against `metrics`' **30-day** TTL, so the gauge was deleted before the
test could read it. The log beside it passed only by racing the merge, because `logs` has
a 365-day TTL — a flake waiting to happen. Fixtures are anchored to now.

**OTLP decodes into the same rows syslog produces, and that took almost no code.**
`uops-otlp` is protobuf in, `LogRow` and `MetricRow` out — no I/O, no async, 21 tests.

That it is small is the point rather than a shortcut. SPEC §M0.3 required
OpenTelemetry semantic conventions instead of a bespoke schema; `uops-syslog::normalize`
had to *translate* `hostname` into `host.name`, and this does not, because OTLP is already
in them. A syslog message and an OTLP record become the **same type**, resolved by the same
resolver and batched by the same batcher. That is the M0 decision paying out.

**HTTP first, gRPC deferred, and the reason is the dependency tree.** SPEC names
`opentelemetry-proto` with `gen-tonic`, which generates gRPC service stubs and pulls
**tonic, h2 and tower** with them. `gen-tonic-messages` generates the same protobuf
structs and pulls neither — OTLP/HTTP carries **byte-identical protobuf bodies**, and the
difference is the framing, not the payload. So the receiver will speak OTLP/HTTP on the
axum stack that already exists, and this crate adds `prost` and `opentelemetry-proto` and
nothing else. Both Apache-2.0; `cargo deny` clean. The Collector's `otlphttp` exporter is
first-class, so this is a complete answer rather than a stopgap.

**Severity spreads FATAL rather than collapsing it.** OTLP's 21–24 map to `critical`,
`alert` and `emergency` — syslog devices really do use all three, and an alert rule
written against `emergency` must not be unreachable from OTLP. A platform where the same
severity means different things depending on which collector produced it has alert rules
that are wrong for half the estate. `severity_text` is kept untouched beside the number,
because the number is an interpretation.

**`host.id` first, `service.name` last.** Tier 1 at 1.00 versus 0.60, and the ordering
matters: a service name maps to *many* resources rather than one host — twenty containers
running `checkout` share it — so a payload carrying only `service.name` resolves weakly and
lands in the review queue, which is correct. The fix is the Collector's `resourcedetection`
processor, which is configuration rather than something this can infer.

**Metrics: Gauge and Sum convert; histograms are counted and dropped.** Those two are what
`hostmetrics` emits, which is what the acceptance criterion names. A histogram is a bucket
array and the table holds one `f64` per row; flattening it multiplies the row count by the
bucket count and makes the `metrics_1h` rollup meaningless, because averaging a bucket
boundary is meaningless. That is an M4 decision, made where somebody will query it.
Dropping them **quietly** would be the mistake, so they are counted.

A Sum is stored as the counter it is, not converted to a rate — same reason the SNMP path
does not: a rate computed at ingest is wrong across a restart, wrong at the first sample,
and impossible to re-derive at another window. `uops-query` does it in `ClickHouse`, where
the counter-wrap guard lives. Monotonicity is recorded as a label, because that guard needs
to know a non-monotonic Sum going down is not a wrap.

**Resource attributes are not repeated as metric labels.** They identify the resource,
which the row already carries as `resource_id`, and repeating them would multiply the sort
key's cardinality by the size of the estate — the exact trap W1 flagged for
high-cardinality grouping.

**`scripts/linux-test.sh`,** because the disk filled a third time. It reads the container
IPs from Docker rather than hard-coding them — they are reassigned on every stack restart,
and a stale address looks exactly like a test failure — and it sets `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0`,
which is the whole problem: the two incremental caches had regrown to 9.3 GB in a single
session. Incremental buys very little in a container that is fresh each run.

**SPEC §M3's first acceptance criterion is met, and measured through the daemon.**

```
offered   49 986/s for 10s, from 1 000 distinct senders
received  49 986/s   — everything
dropped   0
written   501 000 rows in 535 inserts, 0 retries, 0 spilled, 0 lost
queryable 501 000
```

And the ceiling, which is the number that says whether the margin is real: **~100 000
msg/s**, twice the target. Past that the receiver drops — and **counts** every one, which
is the property SPEC's drop counter exists for. A receiver that silently lost datagrams
under overload would look identical to one that kept up.

**The sender count is the measurement, not the rate.** 50 000 msg/s from one device is a
benchmark of an LRU lookup: the same two identifiers every time, the resolution cache
answers all of them, `PostgreSQL` is never touched. So the load comes from **1 000
distinct senders**, each on its own loopback address with its own hostname — which is
what makes the cache a cache rather than a single entry, and what puts a thousand real
resolutions and a thousand provisional resources in the path. The thousand cold
resolutions take 5.1 s and are deliberately excluded from the sustained figure.

That is also why this test is Linux-only: the whole of `127.0.0.0/8` is local there, and
one host cannot otherwise be a thousand devices.

**Two things went wrong in the measurement before anything was learned about the daemon**,
and both are worth recording because the failures looked exactly like a product that could
not keep up.

*The generator was slow, and blamed the daemon.* The first version sent a fixed slice per
10 ms tick and slept the remainder. Every sleep overshoots slightly, nothing catches the
deficit up, and it delivered 49 914/s against a 50 000 target — reported as **"Measured
49914/s"**, while the daemon had taken every message and dropped none. Deriving the quota
from elapsed time instead lets a late tick catch up.

*Then the assertion itself was unsatisfiable.* A generator paced at exactly R finishes
`R × T` messages in **at least** T seconds, so `offered / elapsed` can never exceed R.
Asserting `rate >= TARGET` could not pass however good the daemon was. The criterion is
really a conjunction and is now asserted as one: the load was offered at the rate, all of
it was received, the drop counter is zero, and everything received reached `ClickHouse`.

*And `written` was read mid-flight.* It reported 25 348 of 501 000 because the batcher was
still draining. It is now read after the shutdown, which is the only point at which it
means anything.

**`run::Metrics` exists so the numbers can be read from outside the daemon.** The
receivers and the batcher each kept their own counters and the question an operator asks —
*is anything being lost?* — spans both. A drop at the socket and a drop at the batcher have
completely different causes and the same consequence. It was written for this test and is
what `/api/v1/health` will report.

**The WAL spill, and a bug in `LogRow` it uncovered.**

Retrying in memory handles the ten-second `ClickHouse` restart. It does not handle the
ten-*minute* one: memory is bounded, and past the bound the oldest rows were discarded.
So after three consecutive failed inserts the buffer is written to disk and cleared, and
ingestion carries on against a `ClickHouse` that is still down. Segments are replayed
oldest-first once an insert succeeds — including segments a **previous run** left, which
is the crash case and the reason any of this is on disk rather than in a bigger buffer.

**Segments, not one file.** A single append-only log would need the front truncated to
acknowledge what has been replayed, which no filesystem offers; the alternatives are
rewriting it per batch or tracking an offset a crash can disagree with. A segment is
replayed and then unlinked, so *"what is still owed"* is `ls`.

**The rename is the commit.** A segment is written as `.partial` and renamed once it is
closed and synced, so a crash mid-write leaves a file replay ignores rather than a
truncated one it would read half of.

**What durability this actually gives, stated precisely because the tempting claim is
false:** `fsync` once per segment, at close — not per row, which would cap throughput far
below the 50 000 msg/s target. So the guarantee is *a segment that exists on disk is
complete and will be replayed*, **not** *every message that arrived is on disk*. Syslog
over UDP has no delivery guarantee to preserve in the first place, and claiming the
stronger property is something an operator would plan around.

**`LogRow` could not be read back at all, and nothing had noticed.** The timestamp fields
carried `serialize_with` for ClickHouse's `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.mmm` and **no matching
`deserialize_with`**, so the derived `Deserialize` was left using chrono's RFC 3339 parser
on a string this codebase deliberately writes in another format. Every line of the first
spilled segment failed to parse and the segment came back empty. The types have looked
round-trippable since M0 and never were, because nothing read a row back until now.
Fixed where it was, in `uops-store-ch`, accepting both formats.

The round-trip test asserts equality with the row **`ClickHouse` would have stored** —
millisecond-truncated, because the columns are `DateTime64(3)` — rather than with the
untruncated input. Asserting the latter would be asserting that the WAL is more precise
than its destination, which is not a property worth having and not one it can keep.

**A second bug, from the test that was written to prove the first:** the memory bound ran
on *every* failure including those before `spill_after`, so with a spill configured it
discarded half a batch one retry before the disk those rows were about to be written to.
The trim and the spill are answers to the same question and only one of them can go
first — the spill does, and the trim is now reachable only when there is no spill or the
spill itself failed.

**A batcher given no WAL behaves exactly as before**, and that is a supported deployment
rather than a fallback: a read-only container, or an operator who would rather lose logs
than fill a disk. The startup line says which one you have, because somebody who thinks
they configured a spill and did not should find out then rather than from `rows_dropped`
during the outage it was meant to cover.

`rows_spilled` is **not** loss. The number to watch is `rows_dropped`, which now means
*the disk was full too*.

**The syslog daemon, and how a message gets a tenant.** The decision the whole crate is
shaped by, because **a syslog message carries no tenant and cannot be made to**. RFC 5424
has structured data nobody populates; RFC 3164 has a hostname and a body. There is no
field to put a customer in, and if there were, the sender would control it.

So the tenant comes from **where the message arrived** — one listener per tenant, on its
own address or port, because the binding is the one thing a sender cannot influence.

The alternative considered and not taken was an explicit sender-address allow-list with
unknown senders refused. It is a tighter posture and it loses the logs of every device
somebody forgot to register — which are disproportionately the devices involved in an
incident, because an unregistered device is one nobody is watching. An operator who wants
that posture can have it at the firewall, where it is one rule rather than a second
identity system.

**An unknown sender inside a listener's tenant is not dropped.** The resolver creates a
provisional resource and a review-queue item — rule 1 of SPEC §M0.2, *never block
ingestion* — so a device that starts logging before anybody adds it to inventory still has
its logs when somebody goes looking. The live test asserts exactly this: a datagram from a
device nothing knows about becomes both a row and a resource.

**Configuration is a file, not environment variables.** A listener list is inherently a
list and `UOPS_SYSLOG_LISTENER_0_UDP` is not configuration, it is a workaround. The
connection strings stay in the environment, because those carry passwords and a file on
disk is a file in a backup. The daemon refuses to start on an empty listener list, on two
listeners for one tenant (the shape of the copy-paste mistake that puts one customer's
logs in another's account) and on two tenants sharing an address.

**Backpressure is a chain, and it stops at UDP.** Every channel is bounded and every hop
uses `send` rather than `try_send`, so a slow ClickHouse slows the batcher → fills the row
channel → slows the workers → fills the received channel → stops the TCP receiver reading
→ shrinks the receive window → slows the sender. UDP has no back channel, so the receiver
drops and counts, which is the decision `uops_syslog::receiver` already made: a drop in
userspace is a number somebody can see and a drop in the kernel is not.

**Each listener fans out to several workers.** Resolution is a cache hit almost always —
a mutex and an LRU lookup, fast enough for one worker. The exception is what matters: a
*miss* awaits PostgreSQL, and with a single worker one slow lookup stalls every message
behind it. The batcher is deliberately the opposite and there is exactly one, because a
second would halve every insert while doubling the part count, which is the failure
`batch` exists to prevent.

**It is not given the KEK.** The poller needs it to open credentials; a syslog collector
reads a socket and writes rows. So the compose service does not mount the key that
decrypts every credential in the installation.

**Four live tests against real everything**, plus a CI mutation that collapses every
listener onto one tenant and requires the suite to fail — verified locally, and it does:
*"and the second must have its own"*. Also tested: two tenants sending an identical
message from the same address to two ports resolve to two different resources, which is
the attribution decision proven rather than asserted; a malformed message is stored with
`parse.error` naming what could not be read; and a shutdown writes what is still buffered,
because a batch is up to 10 000 rows and a daemon that returned without flushing would
lose a full batch of somebody's logs on every deploy.

**Ports:** the compose service publishes 514/udp and 601/tcp on the outside and binds
1514 and 1601 inside. Binding below 1024 needs `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE`, which is one more
thing to get right on every host, and a published port is a mapping Docker already does.
The bind error says so when it happens anyway.

**Maintenance windows, and the thing the original sketch got wrong.** The review listed
`timezone` as one field among seven. It is the whole problem.

A one-off window really is two instants. A *recurring* one is not: **"every Saturday
02:00–04:00" means 02:00 where the equipment is.** An installation that stored a UTC
offset would move its maintenance window by an hour twice a year in every country that
observes daylight saving — and would then either fire alerts during the work or stay
silent for an hour afterwards. Both are found the hard way, at 3am, by the person the
window existed to protect.

So a window stores an IANA zone name and resolves each occurrence in it, via `chrono-tz`
(MIT OR Apache-2.0; the embedded IANA database is public domain). That makes two cases
real, and both are decisions rather than accidents:

* **Spring forward** — 02:30 does not happen on the transition date, so a window at 02:00
  has no occurrence that day. Inventing one would suppress alerts at a time nobody chose.
* **Fall back** — 02:30 happens twice. The **earlier** one wins and the duration runs from
  there, so a one-hour window across the transition covers two wall-clock hours.
  Deliberately the safer direction: suppressing less than the operator asked for means an
  alert storm during scheduled work, which is the failure this feature exists to prevent.

`ResourceStatus::Maintenance` has existed since migration 0002 and nothing has ever
written it. This is what will.

**The occurrence arithmetic is in `uops-core`, pure, and the SQL knows none of it.**
`live_windows` returns every window that has not expired and the caller asks each one
`is_open_at`. Teaching PostgreSQL the DST rules would mean writing them twice in two
languages, and the two copies would disagree eventually, silently, in whichever direction
nobody tested. It is also cheap — windows are written by hand, a tenant has them in the
tens, and an alert engine can hold the set and refresh it on an interval.

**A window targets exactly one of a resource, a group or a site**, as three nullable
columns with a `CHECK` rather than a polymorphic `(kind, id)` pair — so each keeps its
composite foreign key and a window in one tenant cannot reach another's site even by
guessing the uuid. The group target is why this waited for groups: *"everything I put in
Dhaka Core Routers"* is what an operator means, and membership is resolved when the
question is asked, so a device added on Friday is covered by Saturday's window without
anybody editing the window.

**Three refusals that are about operations rather than data integrity.** A window longer
than a week is rejected — not a technical limit, but a mis-typed end date whose
consequence is an estate that stops alerting with nobody noticing, which is the worst
failure this feature can have. A window with no reason is rejected, because one somebody
finds open six months later with no explanation is one nobody dares delete. And a
`weekly` window with no weekday is unstorable, because it would be a window an operator
created, can see in the UI, and which silently never opens.

**Where it fails open.** An unparseable stored timezone means *no window* rather than
*window open*. This is the one place where failing open and failing closed point in
opposite directions: a `chrono-tz` upgrade that stopped recognising a zone must mean
alerts keep working, never that an estate goes quiet and nobody notices.

**Overlapping windows union their suppressions.** If either says to suppress alerts,
alerts are suppressed. Any other rule would let adding a second window make the estate
noisier than one, which is the opposite of what somebody scheduling maintenance is asking
for.

**Not done, and named:** no UI, and no alert-engine integration — there is no alert engine
yet. `maintenance_for(tenant, resource, at)` is the interface it will call, and it stops
there deliberately: building the suppression before the thing being suppressed exists
would be guessing at a contract. A window targeting a device also does **not** expand to
its interfaces, which is asserted rather than left to be discovered — silencing a switch
must not silently silence forty-eight ports somebody may be watching individually.

**Resource groups and operator tags.** The two items the architecture review classified
FOUNDATIONAL, built before M4 starts rather than after it.

**A group is the fourth way to talk about a set of resources, and the only one nothing
can infer.** A site is where a thing is, `parent_id` is what it is part of, a
relationship is how it is connected — all three are discovered. *Critical Servers* is a
sentence somebody wrote down. Every M4 feature needs to name one: an alert rule's scope,
a dashboard's filter, a notification routing rule, a maintenance window's target. Doing
this after M4 would mean migrating every one of them; doing it now was two tables and one
`ResourceSelector` variant.

Membership is an explicit list rather than a stored predicate. A rule-based group —
*everything tagged `criticality=critical`* — is a later feature and materialises into the
same table, because an alert scoped to a rule that silently starts matching 400 more
devices is a genuinely bad surprise, and an explicit list is what an operator can audit.

**Tags are a separate column from attributes, and a separate type from `AttrMap`.**
`attributes` is written by collectors on every walk; `tags` is written by humans and by
nothing else. One map for both would work right up until the first time discovery
overwrote `criticality=critical` — silently, and the resulting alert-routing bug would be
unreproducible because the evidence would have been overwritten too.

The precedent was already in the schema and was already right. From migration 0002:
*"`display_name` — user override. Never written automatically: if a human named it,
discovery must not silently rename it underneath them."* Tags are that argument applied
to attributes, and `Tags` is a distinct type so that a collector holding an `AttrMap`
cannot pass it where tags are wanted. The mistake is a compile error rather than an
overwrite found six months later by an operator whose paging rule stopped firing.

`PUT` replaces the whole map, deliberately: that is how a tag is *removed*. A merge-only
API would need a second endpoint to delete one, and *"I removed `criticality=critical`
and it came back"* is a bug report nobody should have to file.

**What the schema enforces rather than the code.** Membership carries the tenant into
both foreign keys — `(group_id, tenant_id)` and `(resource_id, tenant_id)` — so a group
in one tenant cannot contain another's resource even if somebody guesses the uuid. Tags
have a `CHECK` that every value is a string, because a routing rule silently ignoring
`owner.team` for being an object is not a debugging session anybody should have. Both are
asserted in `migrations/tests/` by attempting the thing they refuse, and both guards were
verified by dropping the constraint and watching the suite fail.

**Not done, and named rather than assumed:** there is no UI for either. The API is
complete and the isolation harness covers all seven new routes; the sidebar, the group
editor and the tag chips on the resource page are front-end work that belongs with the
M4 dashboard pass. A tag *language* — `criticality=critical AND environment!=staging` —
is also deliberately absent: `ResourceSelector::Tagged` takes one key and one value,
because an expression grammar belongs in the query parser alongside the log one, not
bolted onto a selector variant where it would arrive without precedence rules.

**The licence is AGPL-3.0-only, with a Contributor License Agreement.** Chosen rather
than allowed to happen: `LICENSE`, every crate manifest and `web/package.json` already
said `AGPL-3.0-only`, so PLAN's recommendation was being enacted by inertia, which is the
wrong way for one of the two irreversible decisions in the project to be made.

The reasoning, restated because the conclusion is easy to misread as "just pick AGPL":
straight AGPL is wrong on its own, because on-premise enterprise procurement is exactly
where it gets blocked — many corporate legal teams keep AGPL blocklists that apply even
to purely internal use — and that market is the one this product is built for. Apache 2.0
is not the fix either; it gives away the only asset. AGPL plus a CLA keeps both: AGPL for
everyone, and a commercial licence for the buyers whose lawyers object.

**The time-critical half is the CLA, not the licence text.** Selling a commercial licence
requires the right to license all of the code that way, and that right cannot be
reclaimed: once one contribution lands unsigned, relicensing any part of the project needs
that contributor's individual consent forever. `CONTRIBUTING.md` already makes a signed
CLA a gate on the first pull request.

What is still open is therefore not the decision but the lawyer. `CLA.md` is a working
draft modelled on the Apache Individual CLA and has not been reviewed by anyone qualified.
That review is the gate before the repository is publicised — not before the next commit.

**Every device was going to acquire a duplicate of itself by its second message.**
The worst defect found since the KEK rotation bug, and found the same way: by writing a
test for the ordinary case and watching it fail.

A device sends syslog carrying a hostname and a source address. Those combine under
noisy-OR to 0.93, which is under the 0.95 auto-merge bar, so resolution filed it as a
**review**: a provisional resource, a queue item, and the device's logs landing on the
twin rather than on the device the poller already knew. Every device in the estate, from
its own traffic, forever. The review queue would have become an inventory list, and the
telemetry would have split across two resources — which is the exact failure this product
exists to prevent.

The bug was that the confidence model was being asked the wrong question. Those numbers
answer *"how much does sharing this identifier prove that two **independently
discovered** resources are the same box?"* — where a hostname really is weak, because two
customers each have a `core-sw-01` and a replacement box inherits its predecessor's name.
None of that applies when the observation's identifiers are **already attached to that
one resource and to no other**. `UNIQUE (tenant_id, kind, value)` makes an identifier
belong to exactly one resource, so a repeat sighting is not evidence *about* which
resource it is. It is the resource, by the assertion somebody already made.

`resolver::exclusive_match` is that rule: every observed identifier already attached to
the same single resource, nothing pointing anywhere else, no tier-1 contradiction. It
goes through `attach_and_record` like any other match rather than returning early, so the
decision is on the record and `resource_identifier.last_seen` still advances — and it
costs nothing at volume, because it is the *uncached* path and runs once per device per
process.

The cache had the same bug from the same reasoning, and its comment was the clearest
statement of the mistake: *"a single hostname is cached and unambiguous but only 0.65 —
not enough to attach telemetry on its own."* Applying the bar there made the cache answer
nothing in the case it exists for, so both of SPEC §M3's numeric acceptance criteria —
50 000 msg/s and a >99% identity cache hit rate — were unreachable. The hit rate was 0%.

`create_for` deliberately still does **not** seed the cache. It would be correct, and it
would make the second observation of every device invisible: no decision row, no
`last_seen`. One extra query per device per process buys the audit trail.

Three existing tests asserted the old behaviour and have been rewritten with the
reasoning above, including the one named `evidence_in_the_review_band_does_not_auto_merge`.
The review band itself is unchanged and still tested — by
`a_partial_match_with_new_evidence_is_still_a_review` — for the case it is actually for:
the address matches a known device, the hostname matches nothing, so the message is
asserting something new and a DHCP lease may have moved that address.

**Every foreign key now has an index on its referencing side.** PostgreSQL indexes the
referenced side automatically and the referencing side never, so every parent `DELETE`
scanned each child table once per row. Eight constraints had no index, including
`user_tenant_role_tenant_id_fkey`, which is `ON DELETE CASCADE` — so removing a tenant
scanned every role grant in the installation, which is exactly what `db.sh sweep` does in
a loop.

Found by the API scale test failing its own clean-up with `57014 canceling statement due
to statement timeout`, inside PostgreSQL's own FK check against `resource_alias`. It
passes alone and fails under a loaded server, which is the signature of something
quadratic rather than something broken. Migration 0010 adds the eight indexes;
`migrations/tests/` now has a guard that fails if any foreign key lacks one, and the
guard was verified by dropping an index and watching it fail.

A product fix, not a test fix. The test does what an operator does — decommissioning a
site, removing a customer, or a retention job pruning stale resources are all bulk
deletes against those same constraints.

**The product is Veyronis; the code keeps the codename `uops` until clearance.**
`Aegisora` had already been rejected in PLAN.md §1 — `aegisora-ai/aegisora` is an active
org in an adjacent market — and `Veyronis` is the replacement.

The audit is in [RENAME_AUDIT.md](./RENAME_AUDIT.md), and its headline is that the
rename was **eight lines of documentation across four files**. Nothing else in the tree
ever contained the product name: not the 16 crates, not the binaries, not the 18
`UOPS_*` variables, not the PostgreSQL role or database, not the ClickHouse database,
not the Docker images, not the `uops.*` NATS subjects, not the npm package, not a
migration identifier, not a test fixture. That is exactly what the codename was for, and
it is the first time the bet has been tested.

So the identifiers stay `uops-*`. The rename to `veyronis-*` happens in one commit **at
clearance** — GitHub org, crates.io, npm, `.com`/`.io`, USPTO TESS classes 9 and 42,
Bangladesh RJSC — which is also the first moment the crates can be published. Doing it
now would re-couple the tree to a name that has had a preliminary search rather than a
clearance, and would pay the cost twice if clearance fails. It also touches persistent
state in a way the documentation rename does not: the database and role, the Docker
volumes, and `UOPS_KEK_FILE`, which points at the key that decrypts every stored
credential. That migration gets written when it is worth writing.

**The repository is now `github.com/Ratul-netizen/veyronis`.** Renamed by hand — `gh` is
not installed here and it needs repo-admin credentials. The four URLs in `Cargo.toml` and
this file followed in the same commit, `origin` was re-pointed, and a `git fetch` against
the new URL confirms it. GitHub keeps a redirect from the old name, so an existing clone
keeps working.

**Syslog over TLS is terminated at a proxy.** The open item asked for a decision and
this is it: no TLS in this process, for syslog or anything else. `rustls`' two
production crypto providers both carry OpenSSL-licensed code — `aws-lc-rs` is
`ISC AND MIT AND OpenSSL`, `ring` includes BoringSSL-derived sources under the same
terms — and neither is on `deny.toml`'s allow-list, which is already why the ClickHouse
and PostgreSQL clients were built without it.

The three ways out were: allow the OpenSSL licence, adopt the unaudited
`rustls-rustcrypto`, or terminate at a proxy. The proxy wins because it is what every
other transport here already does, it adds no dependency, and it keeps the licence
posture — no OpenSSL-derived crypto anywhere in the tree — that `deny.toml` exists to
hold. The cost is honest and belongs in the deployment docs rather than in a crate: an
on-premise install that needs syslog-over-TLS runs stunnel, HAProxy or rsyslog in front
of the TCP receiver and forwards plaintext over the loopback. That is a real
requirement on the operator, and the alternative was an unaudited TLS stack handling
untrusted input from the network, which is worse.

**The pipeline is where syslog stops being syslog.** `normalize` and `batch` are the
two halves of it, and both are deliberately about *not* being syslog-shaped.

`normalize::to_row` maps `hostname` → `host.name`, `app_name` → `service.name` and
`proc_id` → `process.pid` — OpenTelemetry semantic conventions, the same keys the
metrics path already writes and the Query AST already knows. This is the whole product
in one function: a log from a switch and a metric from the same switch are only
correlatable if they agree what the host is called, and the moment one of them stores
`syslog.hostname` instead, the join silently stops existing while both tables still
look fine on their own. The fields with no semconv equivalent keep a `syslog.` prefix
so they cannot be mistaken for a convention that exists.

Which clock wins is decided here too. `observed_at` is the device's timestamp when
there is one and the receipt time when there is not; `ingested_at` is always receipt.
A device with an unreadable clock would otherwise land at the Unix epoch and sort to
the top of every search, which is worse than being a few seconds out — and when the
substitution happens it is recorded in `syslog.timestamp.missing`, so a timeline nobody
can trust is at least one somebody can question.

`batch` turns a stream of rows into the few large inserts ClickHouse wants: 10 000 rows
or one second, whichever comes first. A failed insert retries with doubling backoff to
30 s rather than dropping, because a ClickHouse restart is a routine event and losing
the logs written during one is exactly the failure syslog receivers are notorious for.
The buffer is bounded at 500 000 rows and past that it drops the **oldest** — the
newest rows are the ones an operator is looking at during the incident that caused the
backlog.

`normalize::identifiers` offers the resolver the sender's address as `mgmt_ip` (0.80)
before the claimed hostname (0.65). The address is the strong one in practice because
it is the identifier the poller already wrote, so a switch that is both polled and
logging resolves to one resource with nothing configured; the hostname is whatever
somebody typed into the device, and a relay forwards messages whose hostname is not its
own. Both are offered and the resolver weighs them.

**CI was red and nothing said so.** The `check` job ran `cargo test --workspace
--all-targets` with no databases, so every integration test added since `uops-store-pg`
failed there — five commits' worth. The workspace suite now runs once, in the job that
has both engines; `check` keeps fmt, clippy (which still *compiles* every target) and
the doctests. The API tests had also drifted into the ClickHouse-only job, where the
PostgreSQL half of them could not have worked. One integration job now owns both
engines, because `POST /query` spans them and a test that crosses that seam otherwise
has no home.

**A pre-aggregated query floors its window to the bucket.** Found by running a real
histogram against a real `logs_counts_5m`: it returned nothing, because every bucket in
the fixture began a few minutes before the window did. A bucket is the unit of storage,
so a window starting partway through one either includes it or loses it — and losing it
drops the leftmost bar of every histogram. An Explorer opened at 14:37 would silently
omit 14:35. Base-table queries are untouched.

**The audit hook hangs off the scope extractor, not a list of routes.** SPEC says
"middleware over the query and resource routes", and a layer wrapped around a chosen list
has one failure mode: someone adds a twenty-first route and forgets it. Attaching the
hook to `Caller` — the only way to obtain a `TenantScope`, and therefore the only way to
reach tenant data — means authorisation and auditing share a chokepoint. A handler cannot
read a customer's data without having already been attributed.

**`POST /query` is deliberately not built yet.** Compiling a `Query` to ClickHouse SQL
works and is golden-tested, but nothing executes it: that needs the ClickHouse client,
which is its own piece of work. An endpoint that compiled a query and returned nothing
would be worse than no endpoint.

**The tenant is a request header, not a path segment.** `/api/v1/resources` with
`X-Uops-Tenant`, rather than `/api/v1/tenants/{id}/resources`. An MSP engineer's session
spans several customers, and the alternative — a "currently selected" tenant on the
session — makes a request's meaning depend on invisible state, makes an audit row
ambiguous about which customer was read, and gives a stolen cookie a selection to carry.
A custom header is also a CSRF defence in its own right, since a cross-origin form cannot
set one; that is a second layer under the double-submit token, not a replacement.

**`create_resource` was two different operations with one name.** The repository's is an
operator deliberately adding a device with a name and a site; the resolver's is "something
is sending telemetry and I cannot yet say what it is". On `PgStore` they collided, and the
inherent method silently won. The resolver's is now `create_provisional`, which is what it
always meant.

**A repeated review reuses its provisional resource.** SPEC §M0.2 gives the outcome bands
but does not say what happens on the *second* identical observation — and a device sends
thousands of messages an hour. The first implementation minted a provisional resource and
a queue item per message. Reviews are now deduplicated by observed identifier set, so one
unanswered question is one queue item, and telemetry keeps landing somewhere stable.

**Two sources discovering the same device usually produce one review item.** Worth
knowing before it surprises someone in a demo. A hostname match alone is 0.65, and
hostname + mgmt_ip is 0.93 — both below the 0.95 auto-merge bar, which SPEC chose
deliberately. Automatic joining needs a shared tier-1 identifier (serial, chassis ID,
SNMP engine ID, OTel host ID) or enough weaker ones to clear 0.95. That is the
conservative side to err on: a wrong merge silently corrupts every correlation
downstream, a queue item costs ten seconds.

**`ResourceCatalog` is async now.** It was synchronous in M0 because compilation is pure
and nothing implemented it yet. Every real implementation is a database — the PostgreSQL
one is four `sqlx` queries — and a synchronous trait would have forced it to block a
runtime thread on I/O. `compile()` is untouched and still pure, which is what keeps the
golden tests free of a database.

**PostgreSQL queries are compile-time checked, with the metadata committed.**
`cargo sqlx prepare` writes `.sqlx/`, builds use `SQLX_OFFLINE=true`, and CI fails if the
recorded metadata has drifted from the queries in the tree. So a clone with no database
still builds, and a renamed column is a compile error rather than a 500 in production.

**The bus contract is JetStream's, not a channel's.** `InProcessBus` is a `tokio` channel
per subscriber, but subjects follow NATS matching rules exactly (`*`, `>`), `ack` exists
from the first commit doing nothing, and a new subscriber gets no history. Each of those
would otherwise change *which messages a consumer receives* when the transport changes,
which is not a wiring change. The conformance suite ships in the library as public
functions so `NatsBus` runs the same eleven cases rather than a copy that has drifted.

**Backpressure blocks, and there is a test that fails if it stops.** A full channel makes
`publish` wait rather than dropping. CI mutates `send().await` to `try_send()` and
requires the suite to fail — the same trick as the Postgres and ClickHouse guards.

**`searchAll()` and `searchAny()` do not exist.** `uops-query` was emitting them for
token search — the names the text-index beta announcements used. ClickHouse 26.8 answers
`Function with name 'searchAll' does not exist (UNKNOWN_FUNCTION)`. The real functions
are **`hasAllTokens()`** and **`hasAnyTokens()`**, now emitted and verified against a
running server. Every unit test on both sides passed the whole time this was wrong;
`scripts/ch.sh verify` — which runs uops-query's golden SQL against the live schema — is
what caught it, and is now a CI job.

**Alias chain depth (was open in SPEC §M0.2): collapse on write.** A trigger in
`0004_identity.sql` rewrites A→B to A→C when B→C is created. Merges are rare and reads
are constant, so transitive resolution would put a recursive lookup on the hot path of
every telemetry query. The collapse buys one flat invariant — no `historical_id` is ever
also a `current_id` — which is what lets alias expansion be a single lookup. It lives in
the database because that is only true if *every* writer collapses, including a DBA
fixing something by hand.

## The ledger — progress, and what went wrong getting here

Asked for explicitly. Progress is easy to find above; the failures are the part worth
keeping, because each one changed how something is built.

### Progress

Roughly 690 tests on Windows, one more on Linux, against real PostgreSQL, real
ClickHouse and a real net-snmp agent. No mocked infrastructure anywhere in the
integration suites.

### Failures, and what each one cost

| What broke | How it was found | What changed because of it |
|---|---|---|
| **KEK rotation destroyed credentials** | reading the code while writing `PgSealedStore` | `rotate_kek` read a row, unwrapped its DEK and wrote the wrapping back *unconditionally*. A concurrent `put` on the same id left the row wrapping the old DEK over new ciphertext — silently undecryptable. Now a compare-and-set on `wrapped_dek`, returning `Rewrapped::Superseded`. This is the worst bug found so far: it destroys data and nothing reports it until someone needs the credential |
| **CI was red and nothing said so** | five commits later | the `check` job ran the workspace suite with no databases. The suite now runs once, in the job that has both engines |
| **2 608 leaked test tenants** | the live poller test went from 2.6 s to 29 s | every integration test that panicked before its cleanup left a tenant. Harmless until the poller existed, then a reload read all of them. `db.sh sweep` rewritten; the poller's live test takes its own scratch database |
| **ClickHouse fixtures outside the retention TTL** | intermittent, then reproducible | fixtures dated `1_700_000_000` against 30- and 365-day TTLs; background merges deleted them mid-run. Anchored to now and bucket-aligned. My first fix recomputed per call and broke three tests whenever a run crossed a 5-minute boundary — memoised with `OnceLock` |
| **Six tests passed on Windows and failed on Linux** | the Linux container | `fs::write` leaves 0644 and `KekRing::from_file` refuses a group-readable key. The fixtures now `set_permissions(0o600)` under `#[cfg(unix)]`. The refusal was correct; the tests were wrong |
| **A pre-aggregated query floored the wrong way** | a real histogram against a real rollup | a window starting partway through a bucket dropped the leftmost bar of every histogram. An Explorer opened at 14:37 silently omitted 14:35 |
| **The simulator modelled a GET as a GETNEXT** | a scalar that was invisible in tests but present on the real agent | `entPhysicalSoftwareRev` could never have been read. The simulator now has a real `get_scalars`. A simulator that is wrong in the same direction as the code under test proves nothing |
| **`Runner::load` had a trap** | the scale test was measuring nothing | discovery rules lived in a side map populated only inside `run::reload`, so the 1 000-device scale test measured 1 000 devices whose every discovery job failed. `load()` now does both and is the only way in |
| **Two routes leaked tenant existence** | the isolation harness, once it was given a real vault | `revoke` returned 204 for another tenant's credential and `identifiers_for` returned `200 []`. Both now `NotFound` — 404-never-403 |
| **The Explorer's histogram would 400 on any long window** | reading the compiler after the TypeScript was green | `bucketSeconds` returned two-day and seven-day widths; `uops_query` rejects anything over a day. A hand-written TypeScript mirror of an AST typechecks against itself and proves nothing about the server. Clamped, and four tests now post the Explorer's exact query shapes at the API |
| **A collector was never in the Docker image** | adding the second one, and looking | the syslog service named an entrypoint the Dockerfile did not copy, for two commits. `docker compose config` validates YAML, not existence, and the smoke test only waits for `server`. Now a CI guard greps every entrypoint out of the compose file and requires it in the image. The edit had been applied by a script whose pattern did not match and which printed "ok" from a different substitution in the same run |
| **The retention trap, a third time** | a gauge that never appeared while the log beside it did | fixtures dated 2023 against `metrics`' 30-day TTL are deleted at the next merge; `logs` has 365 days, so its row survived long enough to pass — a flake rather than a pass. Fixtures are anchored to now, and the helper says why |
| **The load generator blamed the daemon twice** | the 50 000 msg/s test failing at 49 914/s | a fixed-slice-per-tick generator is systematically slow because sleeps overshoot and nothing catches up; and then the assertion `rate >= TARGET` is unsatisfiable by construction for a clock-paced generator. Both reported a shortfall while the daemon had received every message and dropped none. A measurement harness is code, and its bugs look like the thing it measures |
| **`LogRow` had never round-tripped** | the first WAL segment replaying as empty | the timestamp fields had `serialize_with` and no matching `deserialize_with`, so the derived `Deserialize` parsed RFC 3339 against a string written as `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.mmm`. Every line failed. The types have looked round-trippable since M0 and never were, because nothing read a row back until the spill did |
| **The memory bound pre-empted the spill** | the test written to prove the spill worked | the `max_buffered` trim ran on every failed insert, including the ones before `spill_after`, so it discarded half a batch one retry before those rows would have been written to disk. Both are answers to the same question and only one can go first |
| **The disk filled, three times** | a Linux build failing to link, twice | `target/debug/incremental` and its Linux twin regrow to several gigabytes per session and had taken the host to zero bytes free — twice stopping Docker's engine, whose virtual disk could not grow. Reclaimed 26 GB, then 9.3 GB. Now `scripts/linux-test.sh` sets `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0`, which is the actual fix rather than a reminder to sweep |
| **The disk filled and took Docker with it** | a Linux build failing to link | `target/debug/incremental` had reached 20.4 GB and its Linux twin 5.5 GB, leaving the host at zero bytes free. Docker Desktop's virtual disk could not grow, so the engine refused to start and every container stopped. Twenty-six GB reclaimed from the incremental caches alone, which cost one non-incremental rebuild and nothing else. See Housekeeping — the recovery is much longer than the prevention |
| **Every device would have duplicated itself** | writing a test for the ordinary syslog case | a hostname plus an address is 0.93, under the 0.95 bar, so the steady state filed a review and a provisional twin for every device. The confidence model was being asked whether two independently discovered resources are the same box, when the real question was whether an observation is the resource its identifiers already belong to. `exclusive_match`, and the same rule in the cache — where the bar had made the hit rate 0%, so both of M3's numeric criteria were unreachable |
| **Eight foreign keys had no index** | the API scale test timing out in its own clean-up | PostgreSQL never indexes the referencing side, so every parent `DELETE` scanned each child once per row. `ON DELETE CASCADE` from `tenant` made removing a tenant scan every role grant in the installation. Migration 0010, plus a schema guard that fails if a new foreign key arrives without one |
| **My own documentation was false** | checking the claim against the data | I wrote that a 24-bit-only OUI lookup returns the *wrong* vendor. The data shows zero MA-M/MA-S nesting inside listed MA-L blocks, so it returns *nothing*. The wrong version was the intuitive one, which is why it survived review |
| **A runaway Python process** | 86 000 s of CPU over 25 hours | an orphan from a malformed heredoc. Heredocs through this shell are now written with a file tool instead |
| **Two test fixtures had arithmetic errors** | writing the assertions | a framed length off by one, and `<189>` asserted as `error` when it is `notice`. Both mine, both in the tests rather than the code |
| **Every timestamp parameter was parsed in the server's timezone** | running the suite against a `ClickHouse` that was not UTC | `{p:DateTime64(3)}` takes the *server's* zone; the columns are `DateTime64(3, 'UTC')`. Same bounds, 0 rows against 21. No error — an empty window, during an incident. It had survived because the pinned image runs UTC. The dev instance is now deliberately left on `America/New_York` as a regression detector |
| **A fuzzer found two panics in its first run** | M7, `tests/fuzz.rs` | `bytes += truncating(slice)` overflowed in both the v9 and IPFIX decoders. Worse than a panic: release builds do not check overflow, so it *wraps* — a byte counter that silently went backwards. The soak runs in debug for that reason |
| **`service.name` could not be both a host identifier and a service's** | M8, trying to fill `service_id` | `UNIQUE (tenant_id, kind, value)` means an identifier belongs to exactly one resource, so whichever resolved first claimed the name and the other matched it at 0.60 — under the auto-merge bar. Every machine in a fleet would have arrived as a provisional with a review item, from its own traffic. The fix is two identities; the test that catches it is the one asserting the review queue is **empty** |
| **A service map that trusted a span id would have crossed tenants** | writing the join | A span id is eight bytes chosen by whoever instrumented the application, so a tenant can pick one that collides with another's deliberately. The join's parent side carries its own tenant predicate, and the adversarial test writes that collision from both directions |
| **§2.6 was wrong about where the map comes from** | building it | It said the map is computed from the aggregate. `service_5m` groups per service per operation, which throws the parent away — and an edge is a relationship between two *rows*. Amended in the document rather than worked around in the code |
| **Stale tests that passed for the wrong reason** | M8 landing | Three tests used "a trace query" as their example of something the compiler refuses. M8 made trace queries legal, so all three would have kept passing while asserting nothing. They now name a logs column on a trace query, which is still refused and still for a reason |

The pattern that catches most of these: implement → test against real infrastructure →
**mutate the code and require the suite to fail** → add that mutation as a CI guard.
Every M2 acceptance criterion has one. A test that has never been seen to fail is not
evidence.

## Housekeeping

**`target/` fills the disk, twice now.** The incremental compile caches grow without
bound: `target/debug/incremental` reached **20.4 GB** and `target-linux/debug/incremental`
**5.5 GB**, which took the host to zero bytes free mid-build. That took Docker Desktop's
engine with it — its virtual disk could not grow, so the daemon refused to start and
every container went down.

Neither cache is worth keeping. `rm -rf target*/debug/incremental` reclaims all of it and
costs one non-incremental rebuild, not a cold one. Worth doing between milestones rather
than after the disk is full, because the recovery is longer than the prevention: free the
space, `docker desktop stop && docker desktop start`, bring the compose stack back, and
**re-read the container IPs** — Docker reassigns them, so the Linux test invocation's
hard-coded addresses are stale afterwards.

Nothing in Docker was pruned. `docker system df` reported ~6.9 GB reclaimable, and all of
it was images belonging to other stacks on this machine whose containers happened to be
stopped. There were no dangling images: the repeated `uops:dev` builds replace a tag
rather than accumulating.

ClickHouse is pinned to **26.8** in `deploy/docker-compose.yml` and in CI, matching the
version W1 was measured on. `bash scripts/ch.sh apply|verify|smoke|reset`.

The PostgreSQL dev database lives in a Docker volume:
`docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d`, then `bash scripts/db.sh migrate`
and `bash scripts/db.sh test`. `bash scripts/db.sh reset` re-applies from empty.

The benchmark ClickHouse volume has been removed — the data is gone, and that is fine:
it is regenerable from seed 42 and nothing depends on it. `bench/scripts/load.sh`
rebuilds it if W1 ever needs re-running. Earlier versions of this file said the volume
still held ~12 GiB; it does not.
